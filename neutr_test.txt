giving this a 3 star because i love it too much to give it a 1, but i’m so disappointed it turns me green! i wear this watch all day every day and keep it dry at that. every afternoon my wrist is green.
i love the watch band but today one of the elastic bands started to fray and will most likely last till this evening. i'm vwr sad since i love it!
it broke!!  after about 3.5 weeks so will not order again. my plan was to order more fro family and friends cheaply made.
very cute but much too large and watch slides under so it can't read or track anything
i liked the watch band but 1 strand broke in just under 2 weeks of wearing.  thankfully i still had my other band to put back on the watch.
the watch band was beautiful but it did not last a week before one if the strings pop and beads went flying everywhere. it is definitely not an everyday band.
this band did its job, but it should not be used everyday otherwise it starts to fray until it actually pop.
i absolutely loved this band but the quality is not good. it broke after only wearing it 3times
loved the band when i got it. however, within three times of wearing it, it broke and beads went everywhere!
it is ok but runs a little small for my wrist.  would prefer to have about another link or 2.
received this product for christmas and it broke yesterday.  the elastic band snapped.  so disappointed because it is entirely too cute!
i ordered the wrong product
the band is beautiful but it broke too easily . after a weeks wear , it became the garbages’ best friend.
i loved the watch band but it was too big for my tiny wrists...maybe you guys can have a smaller size available to petite customers.
didn’t even get to wear it once before it broke.
the watch band is really beautiful but i need a bigger size. i won’t be able to wear it as often, so i’m kinda bummed. still beautiful!
band was very big around my wrist. the watch is too heavy for the band.
it comes with a screwdriver but why, can it be made smaller? ?
so at first sight this is a really cute band but after just a month of wearing it it is peeling the dangling bead fell off the first week and the band is really thin like it's really loose don't wanna wear it worried it won't. hold my apple watch correctly and it will fall and crack. i really like the the look but it's not at all durable really disappointing
received mine on june 17, today is july 20.  i've loved it and received so many compliments and it's very comfortable.  but, it broke today.  one of the metal fasteners came out of the bar that slides into the apple watch.  i'm so disappointed because i loved this band. if it would last longer than a month and 2 days i'd gladly given it 5 stars!!
it’s gorgeous and seems well made and i love it, but since it’s not adjustable and i have small wrists, it’s too big for me. it slides around and causes my watch to lock a lot of the times. if it fit properly i would absolutely love it but i’m unable to use it since it doesn’t.
beautiful, but useless. i have a 6" circumference wrist and this swam on me. it says you can adjust the elastic bands, but be warned this process involves beads running off and not being easy to put back on. when i did give this a decent try, i was not happy with how it looked after and sizing it bead by bead is impossible as you loose elastic trying to re-do it.
the band arrived rather quickly and i was happy about that because i wanted to switch the silicone  band for something a bit more snazzy. i really liked the band-looked really nice on my wrist, was easy to install, and complimented the watch.  heading out the door for church three weeks later, on of the outer strings broke and sent beads every where!! time had passed for an exchange or refund. so disappointed because the product seemed very durable and i received tons of compliments to which i directed others to amazon to purchase this very same band.
overall, this is worth the money.  a friend of mine has worn one for months, daily, and it's held up nicely.  it fits on the watch good.  it looks nice.  it's just too big for me.  i have small wrists.  doesn't look like i could adjust it without being worried it might come apart later as the stretchy parts appear to be rubber under the beads.  if you have an unusually small wrist size, beware this may not fit.  made a nice birthday gift to my friend though!
if you order this watchband watch out for the size. my wife ordered a s/m and its way too small. it actually pulling her skin. she's had others that same size and they were ok. other than that she likes it. guess chinese people have really small wrists. would hope seller sends the next size larger.
while it's super pretty, it's not very tight it moves around so much that my watch will "think" it's been taken off my wrist and i constantly have to enter my passcode to unlock it. because i'll go for a while without realizing my passcode needs to be entered, i don't receive any notifications that have come through while the watch is "locked". incredibly annoying. i used the band for maybe 4 days before i switched back to my old one. wish i wouldn't have wasted the money on this.
i loved this. i wanted to wear it every day. i got so many compliments on it, but i was losing beads left and right, the strings holding the beads were coming undone, so i swapped it out for another one. i now only wear it when i’m going out, and i always bring a back up strap with me when i do in case it completely falls apart.
lots of compliments. didn't last long for the price. wear with care. i wasn't hard on it. i wore it to work and never wore it to bed. i'd buy it again for a dressy look, but probably not any time soon because the price was high enough, i thought it was going to be more sturdy.
the first one broke an elastic string. the second one had a rod slip out of the connector, but since i had the previous one, i was able to repair it thanks to the little screw driver that came with on of them. it is so pretty and i get so many compliments, i still recommend it.
i would normally give this is higher rating however...this is crazy small.
i was so excited to get this band... looks great out of the box. a few things to consider; snug fit, and the rhinestones are already falling after a few wears. :(
i absolutely loved this bracelet/watch band for my apple watch. it's gorgeous on, unfortunately it only lasted for approximately 10 opportunities to wear it and the band snapped and all the pretty little beads went everywhere. it was hardly stretched to capacity, i have super tiny wrists. oh well, i guess i have to find something else. i would say don't buy it unless you just want to waste your money. :(
it’s very pretty but it’s def not adjustable. not sure why it came with a screw driver. there are screws that match but it does nothing. false advertising. it is very pretty though. if you don’t have a tiny wrist like i do this would be good
was really excited to get this new band for my apple watch - so much so, that i purchased both the gray and the pink. they are really very pretty unfortunately in spite of the note they make regarding the size (which should fit my wrist by what they say) - it is uncomfortable and cuts off my circulation. so disappointed especially since i really don't want to pay nearly $8 to return it.  #sizematters
i loved it and it broke in less than 2 weeks :(
i only wore this once and then ended up giving it away. the band is too large for my small wrists, leaving the watch free to move around. it did look nice for a formal event, i was given many compliments. besides the looseness, it was comfortable.
item feels cheaply made.
it's looser than i would like. it makes me nervous the watch face moves so freely. i also find it very itchy. i really wanted to like this. after 2 wears, a couple of the strands holding the beads are coming loose. i would like to return, but i'm not paying $8 return shipping on an $18 item.
i did love the watch band until i received it. one of the bands are twisted. i tried to wear it anyway, but the idea that it is twisted just is irritating. i will be returning, possibly exchanging and hoping i get one that isn't twisted. i'm sure mine is just defective ughh. i was really looking forward to changing my watch band
ordered three of these watch bands— 2 gray and one white. they are all a bit tight on my wrist, but the gray is much better than the white.  picture shows that the elastic on the white one was coming out at the connection with the watch.
it was so pretty and i got compliments on it every time i wore it, but it broke after 2 weeks of light wear. i put off starting the return process and now i’m two days past the return window :(
i am so disappointed because i really like how this looks. but the watch band broke after seven days of wearing it.
i like it, but trying to exchange currently. one of the strings came out, but i love the way it looks. not sure about the quality. jury is still out on if the one i got was a aberation.
very pretty, but a little tighter than i would like. hopefully it loosens up a little
looks cheap and too large for my wrist..
it’s way too tight. if you need a m/l band for your watch this will not fit you.
loved it. had so many compliments, but it broke after just 1.5 months and i didn’t even wear it daily. 😢
really pretty but the band is huge and no way to adjust. i rarely wear it because of this. but i really love the look
i received my band on august 15 and on october 15, it broke. i am attaching pictures.
it was very good looking. but i have a small wrist unable to adjust . had to return seller had no problem with the return
while really pretty, there’s no way to make sure this band is snug. i have small wrists and it was slipping around. totally not secure. i wish there was a way to tighten it.
love the band style ... it's elastic and just a tad too big.  not sure if i can wear it, since it will sometimes spin on my wrist.
doesn't fit tight on my wrist bandits not adjustable.
it's too big (the small/medium) and one side of the latches was messed up. i had rig it to get it to work. it is cute though!
it is very pretty and easy to use but quite large when not stretched at all. i wish there was a way to adjust it.
it's beautiful don't get me wrong, but it's too tight for my wrist. other than that, works well i like it.
my wife loves this band. she got so many compliments. however, after just a few months of wear, the elastic snapped and beads were everywhere. there was no way to repair it.  so, while it is a  really pretty band, it isn’t durable enough to hold up to light wear.
love the look! it is very pretty. however, after wearing a few days the little gems on the connection piece started coming off. i took it off and then when i tried to put back on one side would not lock in.
loved it but broken within two months
fragile and easy to break. received item damaged, didn't even get a chance to wear band but it was easy to see that the quality is not so great and would easily break.
beautiful... but broke on the 3rd wear. very delicate and breaks putting it on.
the bracelet it gorgeous! not happy that i ordered pink and received white. i kept it and willl reorder pink. it's a little loose on my wrist with no option to tighten.
great watch band. just as nice as i expected it to be. i have a 5 inch wrist and this band is to big for me. i was hoping there would be some way i could alter it. short of remaking it that's not an option
i thought i ordered the 38 but got the 42. fits ok but looks odd and not sure if i will were it in public. appreciate the screw driver but no instructions what it was for.
this is very cute but the dangling bead was lost the first day or so and it's a little too tight,. it leaves marks. i would buy it again if there was a larger size.
item arrived and the bands were twisted. overall light weight and fits like a loose bracelet. unfortunately, i’ll be returning, but if allowed i wouldve just swapped it for one not defective
too big for small wrists.. other than that it’s pretty
looked nice, but turned my wrist green on the first day.
i liked the band because it was different and cute but less than one month in and it’s coming apart. i went back to my original band since i was afraid of losing my watch.
it looks beautiful, but it has already fallen apart in less than two weeks. the dangling bead fell off, making the band lose some of its charm.
it's pretty but i've already snagged 3 shirts on it.
looks good but fell apart easily.
its cute but the finish is already wearing off, after a couple of days or wearing it. its overpriced for the quality.
small fit
didn’t last as long as i hoped. i work in surgery and sometimes i had to take my watch off. it laste about 1and 1/2 months and then the beads went flying. expected better for the price...
not good as picture showing in this list.
very pretty but way to small
too small
it’s a little tight but it’s nices
i loved this band, but it did not hold up for every day wear. i received many compliments while it lasted, but the string did not withstand daily use.
it would have been better if it was adjustable
beautiful but loose
pretty, but pretty cheap. turned my wrist green after about 1 week. :(
it’s very pretty busy fits snug
band is a bit uncomfortable to wear.
is very pretty but too large
the bracelet is beautiful but unfortunately after a couple of months the band just broke.
the threads are very flimsy and don’t hold up to everyday wear. beads flew everywhere
mine broke on first use however seller has offered to replace it.  it is pretty but delicate.
it broke after 3 hours of wearing it :(
great product but coating is peeling on the pearls.
the band was really pretty and was perfect for work but it broke the very first day so not worth the money.
if your wrist is small don’t buy not adjustable
beautiful watch but some beads wear off and leave a residue on your wrist.
this band was to tight for my  daughter ...so i sent it back...although the gray one i bought for myself was a little looser,so i gave her mine
i loved this watch band how ever after two months it broke. i did wear it all the time because it was so beautiful. i would purchase it again but am unable to fine on web.
i couldn’t get it on my apple watch.it to big.
some what small for my wrist and can't be adjusted
it is too loose for a small (6 inch) wrist and the watch keeps on locking itself and twits around on my wrist.
this apple watch band is very pretty special and beautiful. it also comes in a nice box, so if you want to surprise somebody it is very nicely packed, too. unfortunately i am very sad, because the band is very large. i don't have small wrists, more on the average i would say and i can still put in 2 fingers because there is s much space. therefore i have to return it. that was - 1 star. the other - 1 star is because i ordered the rose gold assuming it would match the rose gold watch, but it doesn't it is more golden. i could have lived with that, but it's still too wide. i wish they would offer a smaller version or at least one that can be adjusted manually.
love the watch band! recieved so many compliments on it! my issue is the quality... when i pulled it out of the box it was already missing stones.... so i’m hoping i don’t lose anymore but still frustrating when you purchase a new product. the fit was perfect!!
it's a beautiful band, however, i use my watch to track my fitness more than anything and this band fits loosely constantly causing my watch to require me to re-enter my passcode because it's not detecting my wrist accurately so it gets frustrating. i may use it to go out but not on a regular basis at all
too tight for me, but it was pretty. if i didn’t feel like it was strangling my arm i would have kept it.  not for larger arms.
this band runs small/tight so if you have larger wrists, i would avoid. i assumed that there would be a way to adjust but that is not the case. the band has elastic to allow you to slip it on but remains too tight for my tastes. looks beautiful though, so i gifted this to a friend.
one of the band snapped after just a couple of days, and then the whole thing ended up snapping off just a few days after that. not realistic for wearing.
the bracelet only lasted about 2 months, i got it as a late christmas present in january and yesterday morning when i put it on one strand of the beads broke off.  i emailed xhswmshr9c9v1ll@marketplace.amazon.com yesterday when it happened and have not had a response, so i just emailed them again.
not for a small wrist.  had to return. :-(
broke after two days. sending it back. for the price it should be made better
too itchy to wear
i want to give this more than 3 stars, but i just got it and put it on my watch and looked at the piece. a little crystal is missing. i guess you get what you paid for?! i'm a bit diappointed  because it's so nice!
looks great. doesnt hold up well
way too big for my small wrist. very pretty otherwise. i just can't wear it
not worth the price
too big, it can’t be adjusted
it broke a day after i received it. :(
came broken sorry had to return but looked very good 😕
this watch band is very pretty, but painful. i measured my wrist and it was within the measurements suggested, but it is tight and leaves marks. also, little eleastics are breaking off so i expect it won’t last more than 1 year, if that.
very cute but feels like the strings the beads are on are going to snap each time you put it on and i have small wrists
elastic threads holding band together fraying within 10 uses.
i received the band on 1/30/2018 and i’m writing this review on 2/15/18. the band itself looked great when fresh out of the package and attached easily to the watch face.
update:
well it looks really great, and probably is a good deal considering the price. but the silver buckle and the part that attaches to the watch are just plastic, not metal. the connection between the watch and the band is flimsy and keeps popping out of the socket. but not in any way that made it impossible to wear. my bigger concern is that after only a short time of use, the red of the band, which looks so beautiful and textured, has already gotten some wear marks where the red is rubbing off. i still think it's very attractive, and you get what you paid for.  not too disappointed. but a short shelf life...
this is a beautiful watch band, i purchased the navy.  it arrived nicely packaged in a box with a tool to help remove the watch band from watch face, not really needed but it is a quality tool.  although it is a lovely band, it does not present itself well  on my rose colored face watch, as there are silver tabs that are visible from the front. it really does not look good withe rose metal.  if they made the rose metal to match the rose watch i would definitely purchase more colors, as i really like the buckle strap and it appears decently made for the price.
i love the look of it. within two days of wearing it, i had a horrible skin reaction  with itching, painful, flaming red burn.  i am not overly sensitive to anything but this was definitely related solely to this watchband. i assume the dye. took a month for it to truly go away.
the color is nice and it's easy to change out. however, the pin that goes in the hole is really short and you have to work at getting in the right one. also, it tends to make the watch go to the side of my wrist unless it's super tight.
poor quality control on these; the one i ordered had one half in 42mm and one half in 38mm, so on a 42mm watch the clasp side isn';t flush with the sides, and on a 38mm watch the buckle side juts out.
does not fit right on one end into groove.  it doesn’t lock into place.  i have 3 other colors from this vendor that work fine but this one doesn’t.
it lasted less than a year till the metal clip went off in january. for the first time, i was able to manage and get the loose piece back. it happened a few weeks ago and again, i managed. unfortunately, it got loose today when i was outside. no way i can find that little piece in a parking lot. i gave it three stars because it was fine, but i expected it to last longer. no i have to find another watch band.
i've been wearing the watch band almost every day for 2 months. love the color and fit. i get a ton of compliments!! only thing is the back side hasn't worn as well as i would have hoped.
it looks really good, and for the price it has a great quality, sadly i ordered it for my girlfriend and the size i ordered was 38mm and they sent a 42mm size, sadly i can’t return it because we are out of the country on a trip
not very good quality, after 2 weeks of wearing it the color is already coming off the band.
this doesn't look or feel like leather.  it's very stiff and hard; almost feels like plastic so i returned it.
the band is well made, but it is a bit loose when connecting to the apple watch body. i have to be very careful every time i attach to my watch.
nice band. i ended up not needing it though. couldn't return it because they keep half of what you pay. that was a little disappointing
i like the band's look and fell, especially for such a cheap price, but i give it two stars because the longer side of the band is just a tad bit too big when locking it into the watch (stainless steel series 2 space gray) slot. it took me almost 20 minutes to get it out, it got stuck and wouldn't come out. i had to use a lot of force and a few other things to eventually push it out; i thought that i was going to break my watch trying to get it out. i would've returned it but it passed the return date.
color was a much brighter pink than photo suggested (closer to a pepto-bismol pink than a pale pink).  returned.  quality was fine, though.
one part of this band will not fit into the apple watch band channel. the color is beautiful,  quality is fine but the clasp side of this band refuses to slide onto the watch.
the color was on point, however its not very comfortable around the wrist.
kind of started peeling after a few days, i’ve been gentile with it but oh well. band is hard to hook (the medal part to the adjustable holes) sorry i don’t know correct terms. but locks into my 42mm perfectly! matches with everything almost and not too masculine.
the underside is almost pink which i was hoping would be darker. its 5.99 to return, which sucks. i wouldn't recommend it.
the material didn't match the description.
looks very nice until the paint starts to chip after a few months. if it did not chip i would definitely give it five stars.
overall good quality leather. comfortable and more breathable than mesh or fabric bands.
got it for my husband and thinks the color is way too orange, as do i. nothing close to the picture.
i received this product yesterday and the brwon strap looks good for what i paid. however, the back/inside of the strap was peeling a little, i will have to use "krazy" glue to glue the strap together, which is a little disappointing.
this band fit my apple watch.  it is really very masculine on my 6 3/4” wrist although it did fit.  there was a lot of bulk under my wrist because i had to link it into the last hole of the strap.  tried to return it but they charge $6.13 to receive a credit so, obviously not worth it.  one size fits all doesn’t work if you have thin/small wrists.
okay babe but the colors faded quickly and appear to be rubbing off. the brackets that attach to the watch aren't as high quality as other watch bands and can sometimes be a little difficult to attach.
the band broke easily.
good
looked great but after a month the "leather" started to wear away at the sides. i had to purchase a different watch band and throw this one away. poor quality.
cheap, but sort of okay. i kept it while i searched for something better. i'm pretty sure this is not leather--and it should not be marketed as such. i'll toss it as soon as i get a real leather band.
this doesn't fit a large mans wrist. my wrist is about 8.5".
it’s a nice band, nothing wrong with it, i just don’t like it.
fits a very small wrist
this watch band is mediocre. it wore out very quickly, makes my wrist smell weird, and unlatches on one side periodically. i wouldn't waste my money on it.
it's ok not what i expected at all, hopefully it will look better once it's on.
looks cheap compared to other “tan leather” bands
nice color but quality is not what i expected.
this products pictures looks pretty on the site, in person it looks cheap product. not worth the price. was not happy with it at all. leather already started peeling from the band after 2 weeks.
i sent this band back.  i loved the look and fit but it kept falling off my watch.  the small rod that is in the leather part of the band came off of the main attachment that slides into your watch.  it happened 2 times and that is 2 times too many.  i am very disappointed.
the color is pretty but it looks a little plastics to me
i bought this band december 3, 2016.  initially it was very nice, but began showing wear at about 3 months .  it is very nice, soft and secure however the brown color has rubbed off to show black underneath in several places after 6 months.  shopping for another band today.
i thought i ordered a different colored band. i was wanting a light tan color and it's more of a chocolate color. it's good quality.
white color started to fade a couple of days after i started wearing it.
while i love how the band looks on my watch, it is impossible to remove. i have tried to remove the band for days!  it's hard to remove without trying to break the band itself as it's not all that sturdy. i was finally able to get it off today!!! a band should not cause that much hassle to put it on and take it off.
i don't care for and quit using this cover because when i worked out, moisture from sweating would build up under the cover and i'd have to remove to clean off.  i was concerned this would over time damage my watch.  i pitched it!!
it looks good. but it's a little stiff and not very comfortable
not what i expected...i wasn't expecting it to be shiny. not me, will be sending back.
solid replacement band for a more stylish then my previous.. feels cheaply made
the delivery was fast. it was as it was in the picture. i have been wearing for about two months now and the edges are now discolored :-)
i loved this band. the look and fit were great! however two months later and the band is disconnecting from the piece that attaches to the watch. i loved the band but this is happening more and more and i am afraid of losing my watch.
it's beautiful but it picked my skin at it has rough inside surface. so it's collecting dust now. sad though cause the color is great.
works as expected
i wore it for three hours and it broke.
really loved the color and fit. never itched or irritated my skin. however, after less than four months, i need a new one. it’s worn down on both ends. i won’t be buying it again.
found this band to be very cheap looking. the color and texture is almost of a basketball. it does fit well with the apple watch. but will return it since i don't like the quality of the fake leather.
the leather wore out quickly
feels cheap.
easy enough to install & appears to be of good quality but i'm not using it anymore b/c it doesn't really look as good as i thought it would with the rose gold watch.
when i received this strap the first time, the pin fell out the moment i unwrapped the box. i was so disappointed and so i sent an email to the address on the box. within 10 days i received a replacement item and as of now it looks fine. good customer service by the fullmosa team.
looks good in the beginning but the leather cracks quickly.
overall it looks good quality except for the fact that both connectors scratch off the rose gold color from both corners the first time i put it on, it seems they kind of stuck at some point.
a bit thick
it looks great. but the color peels off after a few weeks’ of use. it seems painted on. the color is not permanent.
nice fit but easily noticeable scratches.
very disappointed the color of the leather started wearing off and peeling. looks horrible no longer able to wear it. lasted about 2 weeks before this started.
the white is not a true white, but rather a creamy white.
poor quality - cheap looking fake leather.
looks very nice at first! lasted me 3 weeks of daily wear before the end has already frayed. you get what you pay for, not high quality. next time i will spend more on a quality product.
the band is very stiff.  it is not very comfortable and i will be returning.  i was hoping for a softer more pliable leather feel.
super cute. easy to wear. fits into watch just fine. but leather is starting to shed after a weeks of wear
really good product for the price- however i find the strap itself a bit too wide for a woman wrist.
i thought this would be a little brighter—it is a very dark navy. i still like it, just not exactly what i expected
don’t like the material, look kind of cheap materials
great the first few weeks and all of the sudden started to be hard to take out.
i like it's fun and nice to wear
it's white and gets dirty fast!  but it's nice for the summer.
beautiful look and packaging but too big for the ladies 44mm apple watch.
not made out of the best material, started coming apart.
the leather looks good but when you try to put it in your watch you have to do it with careful, because it's too fragile and the magnets feel like they are going to pop out.
the watch itself was a great color and quality but the buckle tongue was too short for the buckle so you couldn't actually wear the watch.
it to bad for the price
after a week of wearing the watch with this band, the band has turned black and the "leather" has rubbed off. the watch costs $400... the band makes it look really cheap.
had it on for less than 5 minutes since it arrived and already falling apart. glad there’s two pieces of not it’d already be useless.
color started wearing off the band within a few days of normal use. only two starts because they shipped me a replacement band, but it has the same problems. save your money.
i loved this until i noticed peeling and it’s only been a month.
love the quality and the color, the fit is too big for my wrist
color was more of an orange brown rather than dark brown. quality is good.
it's ok for the price. not for everyday wear tho because it will start to slightly peel
i keep having to buy new ones every 3 months bc the leather scuffs.  wish it would hold up better
the color is what i liked the most. however, this watch retains dirt or becomes discolored too quickly
the buckle assembly as designed is too small for the size of the band making difficult and cumbersome to buckle. vendor charges $5.99 minimum for returns.
poor quality. buckle is starting to bend. "leather" is showing red where the color is fadeing.
kind of hurts my wrist. it’s not very flexible.
not a true pink, more coral
i bought the gray band but darker marks appeared where there was wear after a month or so.  i had to throw it away.
love the band but after a few months the grey color has started rubbing off.
it’s alright. it looks cheaper than what it looks like.
color is not pink at all. very peach, almost coral but not.
it was to big for wrist! don’t recommend for those with tiny wrists.
didn’t hold up well.
i like the quality of the product, however the short side of the band doesn't lock into the watch at all. just slides out. therefore completely unusable.
was good for about 2 weeks until it busted 🙄
nice for the price but, unfortunately it gets very dirty quite easily.
good quality.
nice color. as expected for price, the clasp is not very long and falls out of place often.
one side of the band does not lock into place, but seems to stay in place so far (after about a month).
the "leather" started coming off after a week or so.
looks better in picture, looks like cheap leather.
not real leather
doesn’ fit well.  leather is very stiff.
thought band would be softer leather
the white is wearing off.
great product!
cheaply made
it is okay
feels very cheap. would not recommend
the color was more reddish than in the photos
very cheap product
it is nice, but the quality of leather is just ok.
i like the way it makes my watch look. cool looking brown.
although the clasp was firm and i personally felt that i could trust my iwatch in this band i did not like the color. it was too reddish for the gold rose model.
although the band is beautiful.  it is too large for my wrist and i'm not wearing it as it is uncomfortable.
not impressed... thought the quality would be better ... feels cheap
they were ok!
not stable! i ordered this product in black and rose pink.i loved the quality of the bands....until my black one broke and my watch fell off. had i not been paying attention i could have easily lost my $500 series 3 iwatch! :(
the band is just ok. seems very short and i have small wrists.
this band serves it's purpose, i guess. my only complaint is that the band chaffed my wrist where the loops are.
i ordered the fullmosa pink watch band to match my rose gold apple sport watch and although the quality of the band is great, the color is slightly darker in person than listed on the site.
nice but a little too snug for me.
the apple store has a leather band that is $150.  i absolutely drooled over that one, but no way was i going to spend $150.  searching amazon i came upon this brand and ordered it in red.  while it is a beautiful color, the band feels stiff and too thick.  for the price, i got what should be expected i guess, but just because it isn't of the same quality of leather as the apple store one i am not sure why the band has to be so thick.
decent band but doesn't work. i purchased the brown leather 42mm. inside the packaging it asks that if you have any problems, please email them before leaving a review. i did that, and still no solution was offered. band does not "set" or "click" into apple watch. it slides in and slides out, never locks in. completely worthless. customer support was no help. i would not recommend this product. i purchased one from a different company and it works just fine.
i decided to purchase this watch band after wearing my expensive brand from apple.  i was pretty hesitant since my apple bands work great. i was trying to save money and found out the hard way that it is not worth it.
cute but cheap feeling. i work in an office and at a computer all day. so the paint on the bottom portion of the band where it touches a keyboard is worn off after about a month of use. it was very easy to attach the band to the watch. the pins are secure so far. but overall disappointed. i guess you get what you pay for.
this watch band is ok for the money.  you can’t expect hermès for $10.  i’ve had it a couple of weeks and it’s doing a fair job.  i bought the light blue and the color is ok.  fits the apple watch fine.  good for a change. wouldn’t wear it every day.
i think the band is very nice looking but the non-buckle strap won't lock into the watch and slides around. it looks like a few others have had this issue, as well. the box asks you to email them before posting negative feedback, but from what i gather from the other reviews there is no guarantee it won't be replaced with another faulty strap!
this does fit tiny wrists but the color rubbed off almost immediately so it looks like crap. the band does seems to be holding together better than any other i've purchased so far but i wouldn't buy it again just based on how it looks after a few months of wear.
it don't have a perfect adjust in the lateral close
pretty from a distance, but the band is rather stiff so it doesn't bend well to fit the wrist.  if you have a small wrist, know that this will be pretty large.  it does, however, have two loops to hold it down.
the watch band is very attractive. i’ve gotten a lot of compliments on it. however, i’ve had the band for about a year now and it’s falling apart.
i like the leather material and everything until i almost lost my watch while playing golf few days ago.  the pin connecting the leather band and the metal peace was pop out when i played golf.  fortunately i noticed i lost my watch not too long after that and found it on the fairway close to my last shot.  i tried to pull the other band and got the same issue.  i don't want the hassle to replace it, so i took the pins from my old apple band to use on this new band.
bought the pink strap.  loved the color.  the connector (the hinge piece that holds the leather to the watch) broke the second time i wore it.  very very disappointed.
this was for my wife. it looks great and is high quality however she reported that after a while the buckle irritated her wrist. she eventually stopped using it because of this.
i did like this watch band initially but it gets stinky after a short period and it easily scratches and removes the leather in spots
band is beautiful and color is nice but i can't get it rounded to my wrist. maintains an awkward oval shape and doesn't feel good when i wear it.
it looked good at the beginning but then color started to fade at the edges
it is pretty, but it didn't take much time before the white wares off.
i like the shade of red.  but!  it is a pretty cheap material so the "leather" like material started to chip quickly.
the leather feels kind of cheap, but for the price it’s still a decent buy.
for the price it works but not good quality and leather color is rubbing off after a few uses.
looks nice but cheap
i really love this watch band but after a week it's already rubbing off the white ☹️
i gave 4 stars before but now i am a little bit disappointed the color is peaking off :(
i love the way it looked, but it kept not locking correctly and almost dropping the screen. i have sense had to just stick to apple watch bands instead of going elsewhere.
it doesnt look like high quality leather. it also became discolored and worn after a few months of wearing. structurally it continued to work well.
ehhh...given the price and quality its ok!
this is a very thin band.  i didn't really care for it, and i haven't work since i purchased it and tried it one time.
good first impression, but pin started coming off after 6 months.
the black band looks dark brown.
very nice quality band. beautiful red color. unfortunately the buckle rested on the tendons of my wrist and caused pain. it is a very nice quality band.
it gives my apple watch a brown band when i need one. it works but, it looks and feels kind of cheap. considering it is relatively cheap i guess i don't have much room to complain. you get what you pay for.
band not soft enough, and it's too the end of strap is too square
this isn't a very true black. it almost has a brownish tinge to it.
its great, don't shower with it though! i made that mistake
just love the color... not the cheap looking "leather..."  looks like the same fake leather used in cars these days.
decent band for the price. peeling after about 2 weeks, but not bad for the price.
nice color but it doesn't sit very well on my wrist compared to the silicone ones.
i would say you get what you pay for. do not expect it to equal in quality a $150 band from apple or even a $70 band from piel frama.
looks very nice at first- after a few weeks, is starting wear off paint on leather on lower side of band
it is a nice band.  the right color and everything, but it so thick.  it is hard to buckle.
dislike the fact that the edge sticks out and hooks things
after wearing for about a month, band started to wear down the color.
feels cheap but looks ok
after wearing this band off and on for 6 weeks, the leather started to wear more than other watch bands i own.
leather band is nice. but i wish the stain came with gold as well to match my gold iwatch.
quality of the leather is not great.. looks a bit like plastic.
returned this product, it looked very cheap.
very poor band
very soft, more comfortable than a regular leather strap. the connection between the watch is quite loose, but not too bad considering the price.
unfortunately, it looked a little too plastic for me. the color was a funky brown and just looked too cheap. i had to return. :(
band is very chunky,  more masculine - not feminine.  it is not tapered.  nice band otherwise.
the band is really nice and true to color. it didn’t last long until it looked like i’ve had it for years. not satisfied.
looks great at first, got a good amount of compliments but started discoloring after a few months.
the leather was way to brown.
i like the band but it has a weird fishy odor that won’t go away.
the product looks great but one of the sides of the band is hard to slide into place and even harder to remove.
looked great in the beginning, but the white wears away after two months of use.
this band came in in more of an orange tone. did not match my apple iwatch at all. returning asap and purchasing from another company
love the band and the fit, but 3 stars because the material stains very easily.
a little stiff but looks good
good quality band. however, the box says it's for 42mm series 2 apple watch but there are gaps where you attach to watch. returning.
strap didn't come with a shorter piece (just a long one) so i find it a little long. leather is fine.
sent back for a refund. too big for my wrist.
the material is good but is to complicated to fit the band in the watch.
kinda stiff and uncomfortable to wear
the white on the band started chipping off within a week.
it looks great but i am a little concerned about how long it will last because for $15.00 i can't expect it to last forever. seriously people, what can you expect from a "leather" band for $15.00? the annoying part for me is that the lower strap's connector wouldn't easily fit into the lower case's adapter; i had to really push it in whereas every other watch band i own slides effortlessly. the top strap was smooth as expected. i tried inverting the straps and connecting the lower (longer) strap to the top and vice-versa and it fit just fine which was odd to me. nonetheless i used the included tool to switch the adapters on the straps so i can wear the watch as i am accustomed to: longer strap on the bottom, shorter (with clasp) on the top. switching the adapters worked fine but it was annoying to have to do that.
material cheap and band is small!
it works would not order again
it came quick and in nice packaging and looked great for a few months. but not real leather, the backside of the band has started to crack and separate from the top side. the top side has also started to wear oddly with the edges turning black.
i like the look - although i’d prefer if the brown was a tad darker - and the watch fits great!... until yesterday. for some reason, one of the bands don’t click into place anymore. that’s a very bad thing seeing how that can increase the chance of your watch flying off and getting lost or broken. i was wondering if it was just the apple watch, so i put the original bands back on and they both click into place. i like these bands, but i don’t like them enough to risk losing or breaking an expensive device.
this is definitely a good looking band for it's price, however, one of the connectors is extremely loose and wiggles inside of the watch, slightly sticking out. it's not flesh with the other connector, which seems to be fine. for this reason, i fear that the watch could become detached at any time, rendering this band useless for me.
i’m disappointed. the band looked nice, feels nice but the band separated from the apple watch connection. the pin holding the band to the watch connector came loose. while i could fix it, i shouldn’t have to do this for a brand new product. i can’t say if this a problem across the board but this was my experience
color is way lighter in person for the dark brown
the quality of the leather ... well, it stinks. looks more like plastic. if it is leather, it doesn't look like it. i kept it only because i figure in the right setting, i could fool people into thinking it was a good quality band. but if anybody gets close to it, the jig is gonna be up.
decent quality, but has an orange glow, that my wife made fun of me for. she thinks i should buy a belt and some bell bottoms to match. back the seventies!!!
this band fit well on my watch and i love the style of this band but was very disappointed that the magnetic clasp scratched the first day of wearing.
felt like a waste of moneub
the red band was a true cherry red as described, but not sure if it was real leather. the inside felt like vinyl and made my wrist sweat, while the red color was peeling off the outer band. i sent it back.  seller very helpful, and i got a promt refund.
seems well made,but the leather color is more burnt orange than pictured, and the hardware is more bronze than my space gray apple watch.
i have tried numerous ways to latch my band but need help because the latch is too small.  the latch won't easily fit into the hole in the band.
nice band, but it’s kind of stuff and doesn’t feel comfortable on my wrist.
the product looks more fake and plastic-like in person. i don’t think anyone would believe this is genuine leather by looking at it. the quality seems okay so far, but i haven’t had it long enough.
for the price, it looks great. only thing i don't like about it would be that where the bands connect to the watch have a decent amount of play compared to the one the watch came with which has no play at all. it does lock in, but wobbles.
this is probably okay if you need a cheaper leather watch strap. i'm not crazy about the buckle being a bit large, and not quite my style. the leather feels fake, and doesn't feel great when you wear it. i only wore it for a couple weeks and decided to get a better one.
color is not accurate to picture. the band is more orange than brown.
i’ve had this watch band for almost 2 weeks. i’ve worn it everyday for that period. today my watch came loose and fell to the ground twice. the connection on the band (the metal portion) disconnected without warning. i use the second notch most often and there is significant wear and tear there. on close look the area of the notch looks as though it would break apart. i didn’t expect the world of this band due to the price. however, i did not expect the band to come apart causing the watch to fall to the ground and i did not expect significant wear and tear after only 2 weeks. i’m disappointed, especially after being so positive in my initial review after receiving the band.
this band is white on the surface.  it will wear off on the edges and look dirty and cheap.  lasted 2 months.  you get what you pay for in this situation.
it’s cute but right inside the band there are two stitches that is soo uncomforfortable . those stitches rubs against your skin
the price reflects the quality! and they want more than half the cost of the item to return it.
it cracked really quickly on me
i’ve had this for five months now. it’s very durable wrist band. my only complaint is the color fades.
quality for the price is decent but i developed raised, itchy bumps around my wrist where the band rubbed. i can’t wear it without having a reaction to it. the pink color gets dirty quickly.
super cute and fairly comfortable. would be 5 stars but the metal is cheap and gave me a rash after about 2 days and the rose color on it started chipping right away as well. pretty much unwearable now. might try for short periods of time.
it’s a pretty band. a little on the stiff side but it smells like leather. if it is in fact leather, it should loosen up a bit to make it easier to put on. the little metal piece that goes into the adjustment holes is very short which makes it a bit awkward when trying to put your watch on but not a deal breaker. i got the white and rose gold one. looks very nice with my rose gold watch but i’m sure that the band will become dirty from my blue jeans just like all the other white bands i’ve purchased in the past. i just really like white bands so i’ll cross that bridge when i come to it. overall, cute band.
the band is soft and  flexible. i was worried it would be too stiff but so far it feels fine.  i will update the review after having worn it for a few days.
nice looking band but one of the straps to hold the band in place broke after 3 weeks. i emailed seller and was told to send pictures. i did that and no follow up.
i like the magnetic closure on this band. however, the band is loose in the clasp/connection that attaches to the watch body on the side where the band loops back on itself. there's about 1/16 inch space in which the band can move back and forth as you're wearing the watch. i was expecting the band to fit better with little or no extra slop space. this band had been greatly discounted to less than $8, so even though the quality isn't what i would want, i can't complain too much. but i would not recommend it.
too heavy and bulky for me. i found that i like to hold my ipad more than i realized so this wasn't good for my usage. it was returned. i did receive a credit back immediately so i am very satisfied with the seller.
i like the look, but day two it fell apart while wearing it and fell on the concrete , thankfully i was not fishing or riding a motorcycle or my whole watch may have been a loss. super disappointed in it, looks really nice and seems like if it was assembled proper it would be a nice band.
*edit* took it from three stars to two due to the fact that the seller thought that bribery would convince me to change my three star review to five. instead, they now get two.
this band is not so great. first off, the magnet is not strong and the band keeps getting loose on me. very annoying to have to constantly re adjust it. second, the areas where the magnet holds is now starting to discolor and become silver. it’s scraping the black off. third, the edges of the entire band are coming i guess loose and getting stuck to clothing and are now sharp when you touch them.
update november 14, 2016
updated review - the velcro stand is wearing out after having the case for less than a year. the previous case that i had for my ipad 2 held up much better. pretty disappointed.
i liked the look of this band.  it arrived on time and matched the description.  however, after wearing it less than 5 times the band broke at the adapter while sitting down to lunch at a restaurant.  i only noticed because the watch fell to the floor.  attempted to contact the seller and got no response.  there is a tiny screw that holds the adapter together that came loose.  buyer beware.
the case was ok for perhaps a child. looks clunky and cheap.
it's nice, but now that i think about it the pricing is a little too much for it.
dislike that it snags my hair on my arms on and off. my wrists are too small for this. i have to tighten it as far as it goes which is still not tight enough. but it looks nice and it’s magnetic which is cool too.
product arrived on time and was easy to unbox and install on my apple iwatch. however, while wearing my watch, it just fell off my wrist with no warning. apparently the pin had come off my band. the pin is so tiny i could not find it. my thankful my iwatch was not damaged.
good looking band but metal color wears out with very little use. the magnet tends to stick to pretty much everything when you wear this so be aware, didn’t work for me as it gets caught on everything metallic. has no flexibility while on the wrist as expected from a metallic band, caused numbness in my arm so went back to the original one.
while the color is great, using the crown is difficult to turn. pushing in button will take some getting use to since it is now sunken in. however the crown can still be easily pushed in. magnetic clasp seems strong, but have only had this for a day.
it's ok. let's see how long it holds up with the velcro
i like the gold color, it is not too bright. however, the band is very long and fits me a bit loosely even at the tightest. i wish it came in a smaller size. i have small wrists so it tends to wiggle around a bit. the magnet feels fine, it does move around during the day and i have to readjust but not enough for it to fall off.
great product except the velcro ruined several of my garments.  other than that, i love it.
it works great- the design looks like the apple version except there are parts that are discolored so part of the band looks black and parts of the band look grey silverish in color.
the magnetic watch band for apple watch 42mm series 3 is not a bad product.  it looks great and professional.  however, it feels very uncomfortable on the wrist.
pros: cheap. fits well. strong magnet.
even the band looks and feels great, the magnet buckle is already discoloring. this is definitely mediocre quality.
the fit is good. but it is cheap. i’ve worn the band less than 10 times and the black coating is already coming off. also, if you have sensitive skin. i would definitely not suggest this product.
i thought it had a case with the band but it was just the band.
the band is uncomfortable and rubs against your wrist at times. the magnetic tab will stick to just about anything that is metal/magnetic. it can become a nuisance during the day.
the magnetic strip is not very strong and i am constantly having to tighten it up.
black color getting lost as you use it and gets ugly after little usage
i enjoyed the band part-time for three months before the connection to the watch fell apart.  this band was in the rotation with two other bands and they have both lasted longer.  i hoped the band would last longer so i am giving it a poor rating.
the part of the band that connects to the watch broke off after only using the band for a month. i hope the  company see's this email and responds. i was wearing it in the cold weather and if i had not been wearing a jacket, i would have lost the watch
broke after less than 2 months of irregular use, often used other bands and only wore this occasionally. magnet connector came off of long side and almost lost the entire watch.
velcro gathers too much fluff.
i love the ease of install and use, it’s exactly what i wanted. however, the magnetic part slips a lot so i’m constantly having to readjust it because it slips into a looser position by itself a lot.
i really like the look of this product, but sadly it doesn’t keep my watch in place. the magnet slides a lot and causes the watch to be loose.
terrible quality. i purchased the black colored band and the paint began rubbing off within 3 weeks of normal wear. i would not purchase again and urge those who read this to look elsewhere as well.
scratches easily and magnet attracts metals.
cool
band broke
not bad
rusts up quickly if you’re a athletic invidual.
the description of the case said "synthetic leather/leather" and i assumed it would be at least partially authentic leather but it appeared to be completely synthetic. i confirmed that it is all synthetic by visiting the zugu web site. i did not feel the case was worth the money due to the materials used. i only tried the case on for about an hour, then kept it in the envelope it came in until i mailed it back and upon inspecting it before i sent it back i noticed it already had a little little divot in the leather on the front. perhaps the case came like this but i can only imagine scrapes and tears being an issue with normal use. also i didn't understand why there were so many fingerprints on the case and thought perhaps the black dye was rubbing off a bit. i am still not sure what caused the prints - whether it was the dye rubbing off or some sort of reaction between something on my hands like lotion and the synthetic leather. i certainly did not apply lotion right before i handled it...and i tried to wipe it clean with a wet tissue but they would not come off. i also expected this case to be more protective and it didn't seem like it would suit my needs. it would make me nervous to drop my ipad with this cover on it. this is much like a high quality school binder. my favorite thing about the case was the ability to prop it up at any angle and have it stay in place with the velcro. i also liked the soft interior to prevent scratches. although it did not seem drop-proof (it doesn't claim to be however) i probably would have kept it for a lower price.
rusted an my warped after a couple of months
note: i'll be posting the same review under both the brown and black, because i ordered both and am having the same difficulty with both.
comfortable and stylish but if you move a lot with it on then it starts to slip. also the paint wears off pretty quickly,
love this band.
the quality of the mesh is very good. however on one side of the strap the fit is not simetrical. see photo
it broke really easy. i liked how easy it was to put on.
decent case but a bit bulky. buttons were a little difficult to access due to cover getting in the way.  not terrible but expecting a bit more for the money.
i have purchased several milanese loop watch bands before from amazon and this one is of the lowest quality so far. as soon as i unboxed it i could see right away that the metal mesh would not lay flat without kinks nor line up with itself once installed. the metal is very light and low quality feeling and of all the bands i've owned this one pulls on arm hair.
bought this watch band last week. nice leather band. cons are stitching came loose within days of wearing it. secondly the band is way to small for bigger wrists.
broke in a week.
pinch my skin
the strap is nice but the part that connects it to the actual watch isn't a really snug fit like i'd expect it to be. it almost feels like the band could go loose and fall off my wrist.
nice case.. sturdy.. didn't like the velcro strap attached.. already starting to fray..  good for a first cover.
this watch band is not quality leather.
seemed to be a good band. however in less than three days, the small screws that attach the metal rings to the watch band came out and the band is useless without the metal rings. the company does send extra screws and a screw driver but no extra metal rings ( which come in two parts). i did put an email in to them. hopefully they will help me
if you compare the actual product, versus the picture of the product, you can see that it’s not a match.
i was excited to get a band that was not professional and slick. i was disappointed with this band. it pinched my wrist and pulled my hair really bad. the magnet also kept slipping and the watch would get loose throughout the day. super displeased with this product.
decent band except that one tiny link was broken at the edge when it arrived.  so there was a very sharp, metal piece poking my wrist.  i bent it into the band so it doesn’t hurt.  but still annoying.
watch band is great but it already is broken. the one end will not snap into place. it seems the one side of the notch got stuck inside. really wish it didn't break because it's a great band.
my apple oem leather loop was finally starting to wear apart, so i wanted a cost-effective replacement "loop" band to get me by until i buy the next generation band (i have a series 1). this certainly fits the bill, and at its pricepoint, it's tough to complain. however, after a few days of use, a few annoyances have made me realize, you get what you pay for. first, from appearance alone, it certainly appears more expensive than it is. it installs easily and first impressions are real high. my issues with the watch after a few days use are:
poor fit for an ipad air 2.
the band was ok but there were small metal pieces sticking out of the side that would catch on clothing, they were easily cut off. after only 6 weeks, the band just popped out of the holder, unsure if i will purchase it again, it was always very comfortable but didn’t last very long.
item is great build quality for the price but the issue with it is if you buy any colour other than silver be forewarned the paint on the metal will wear away and fast especially in the area where the magnet clamps but at this price i’ll just buy replacements when needed
orbs ok, sometimes the latch gets caught on stuff and unhooks.
sending it back.  started getting a rash about 5 hours into wearing it.  plus it pulls out the hair on your arms a little bit.
band doesn’t stay on and comes off, having to unlock my watch every single time when band comes off, was not going to change my watch settings because of poor quality band.
it looks great. a little to big and the holes are large.  sometimes it comes undone.
i have a small wrist so this is really big on me. if i move my hand it feels like the watch is going to come off. i think this would only work if i'm not moving around too much.
getting ready to send it back.  the band is great....seems to be good quality.  however the clasp where it attaches to the watch just broke.  only had the band 2 weeks and i don't wear the watch every day.  bummer it didn't hold up.
it's a decent cheap band, and ive actually gotten a couple compliments on it but i don't love it. it's clearly very cheap, and is already quite worn after just a couple weeks of wear. the biggest issue i have though is that the top half of it does not properly click in to the watch body so it slides out very easily. i had high hopes but i think i may need to look elsewhere.
nice product. i have only had this band on my watch for two weeks and this morning it broke.  the metal bar just snapped and my watch fell on the floor.  not happy about that.
the quality of the band was quite good.  i only scored it down because it didn't fit even on the tightest hole.
i wish if it was longer!
fell apart on me after one month.
too small for my wrist. need other length choices. thought it would stretch a little after wear, but not enough.
i liked this band when it came but after few months of use it is already broken and i did not use this during any sport or gym or any other activity which could have caused any sort of stress but still the pin on one side fell off automatically :-( and now i am back to my old band which has been working for more than a yr... guess will have to buy another one now
crappy band
wore it for about a two weeks before it started looking bad. the leather stretches out, obviously, but this one stretched out by almost a full hole size. this is partly because the hole it was being used in enlarged by about 50% in length, so it's now a huge hole. also, if you use any sort of leather treatment, the leather continuously sheds the dye and it ends up staining the threads. then you have to carefully use the cleaner on the threads themselves so it doesn't absorb the dye color and permanently stain them. even with all the work, the threads now have a light grayish tint to them that i cannot get out.even with the leather treatment, the leather has this white shedding along the surface, almost like the leather is molting.
as described
yes it’s a watch band and it goes around your wrist, with the benefits of it start to wayne after a few weeks as the black on the band starts to wear off and now it has become rather tattered appearing. after six weeks i’m going back to my old band. you might want to use this for a special occasion, but it is not durable for every day use.
the magnet hold slides slowly while wearing, causing the need to readjust. and it pinches my hair. not a fan
it’s super cute but none of the reviews mentioned how it gets your hairs caught and that hurts
purchased for my 40mm apple watch 4. it's thinner than other non-apple milanese loop bands that i've purchased, which is a little disappointing since they were all similarly priced. there is a bigger gap than i would have expected where the band loops and it's fairly noticeable. the magnet is very strong almost too strong as the band bunches up when i take off the watch. the silver looks good with my aluminum watch case, just don't expect it to match.
i really enjoy the look and the style of this band.  unfortunately, it gets snagged on clothes and has caused damage to more than one piece of clothing.  it will be returned.
my husband didn’t really like it bc it kinda gets stuck on his skin. i tried it on myself and wasn’t too happy with it either but not a bad buy.
its true. you get what you pay for. the watchband is nice but it caused a rash, and can return the $10 item, but it’ll cost me $6.99 for the privilege.
light weight than the apple band, which i took it as a good thing. texture is just as soft as the apple ones. the button does not close with smoothness as the apple, instead it sort of clicks on which i’m not too bothered by. gave it 2 stars leas because the band has a gas like odor which is extremely strong. been bothering me all day until i noticed it was the band. shipping was extremly fast which i was satisfied with. if the smell doesn’t bug you then take this item as a 5 star.
this is a nice looking band, and it feels okay - but is a bit stiffer than genuine apple bands, and many of the knockoffs out there that are around the same price.  instead of the supple silicone feel, this feels a bit more like regular rubber or plastic - more like a swatch band might feel. it's not necessarily bad - just different.
i love that this is an exact replica of the band on the apple website but for way less! the color was just as described. however, i find that it is a little difficult to fasten. i put the button in the hole but the button comes out once i secure it. i have to hold on to the button when i secure it. it’s not a huge deal and you get what you pay for. overall great substitute for the expensive bands on apple.com!
i first got this band in cocoa, and it's a little greyer than i anticipated but i love it with my rose gold watch. i don't really like pink hues, and this band really brings out a bronze tint to the watch. i loved the band so much i got another one, this time i got the rose red. the picture made it look like a very deep red, but it's actually a lot more pink - almost a bright magenta. i really wanted a deeper red since i don't like pink colors, so hopefully i can exchange this color for the color it displayed online.
when i first put the band on my watch, you could tell it wasn’t the best quality and a lot fuzz from my clothes and dry skin would stick to the band and would have to be constantly cleaned. after a month of wear the metal on the band has rusted. i don’t shower with my watch on but washing my hands some water gets under the band. you get what you pay for. this would probably be best if you don’t wear the same band every day and switch them out.
i like the watch band but it
love the color, however it won’t stay done up. seller did refund my money for the problem
with my wrist size it is either too tight or too loose. also i developed a reaction to the band on my left wrist.
not really the color described, more of a periwinkle.
really loved the color and feel to the watch band but when i put it on the metal clasp came apart right after attaching it to my wrist. so disappointed. glad i wasn't running when this happened.
a little snug compared to other bands i’ve bought, but does the job fine.
the color wasn’t really what it was. disappointing that way. also i can’t return some mod them. just beware.  some colors are not as they seem
i like how soft and light it is.  i am worried i might loose my watch as the band doesn't seem very secure.
quality looks good but i couldn’t try it on my watch, got the wrong size and color.
the band is thick and is difficult to slide into and out of the slots.
won't fit in my watch
i expected more of a cobalt blue. it’s a bit on the lighter blue side.
i like the way it feels and the quality but the color was totally not walhat i was expecting. i got more of a pink.
i wore this band for one day and lost my apple watch due to the band coming undone. terrible disappointment! would not suggest this band
it’s okay, the band isn’t very easy to put on, always pops off so it takes longer to get on.
i like the the feel of the band. however, it doesn’t fasten as well as my last rubber band.
the silicone is already chipping on the hole i use. the plastic holdings are also falling out. looks good cheap build
i really don’t like this band.
item is nice but feels extremely cheap, band keeps sliding out of my watch face at random times and won’t stay.
band i love but received the wrong color when ordered. i ordered antique white and got just normal white.
band broke within weeks, and ended up breaking my watch when it broke.
the color is all wrong ,pink is tan ,tan is deep brown,the length is great mm is ml
not the whole apple watch but it's worth it
the quality of the band seems good and worth for the price. there at the band connector slots there is a little space but it’s not the highly priced apple products or associated premium bands to have great precision. the only isssue i have with this the color is not accurate at all. i thought i ordered or at least expect it to be a darker and richer blue but i got this washed out blue color which is between a light and medium dark blue.
it’s hard to close it keeps opening
no me llego ordene dos no me llegaron
ordered the burgundy color and what i got in the mail was the soft pink. still cute but not what i ordered.
this watch band is no good. i was excited to have a watch that fit my wrist so well, but i believe the clasp is upside down because the extra bit of band sticks out instead of goes under the band. the band also falls off very easily. i was not pleased. if the band stayed on it would be of good quality.
okay for the price, only wear it to work. when i received it the color was already fading in some spots.
i like the color and it seems durable however when i was first putting in on my watch, one of the little pins that holds it in the watch keeps popping out. i'm lucky i haven't lost it yet because it's so small.
well, i did receive a defective clasp, but that is not why i gave this item such a poor rating...  basically, i liked how the band felt, but it was loose where the band went through the clasp.  on an apple band, the tolerances are much tighter and it is extremely noticeable.  if only the band was a little wider, this would not have been an issue.  now, for the price, it is a usable band.  if the clasp had not been completely broken so it didn't stay in the watch, i would have kept it even though the band was too narrow.  but since i needed to return it anyways, i would not get another.  i know it will cost over three times as much, but i am going to just get the official apple band.  if that is too much for you, this is a perfectly workable band.  i just don't like it.
i purchased the sport loop black band in february and it fit perfectly.  so i decided to purchase this sport loop dark black band, but i'm only giving it two stars this time because this band is much shorter than the other band and i can barely fit my fist into it.  i have an average wrist so getting the band on and off should not be a problem, it has not been with the other band.  when i measured the length of this band with the other band, this one is bout one inch shorter which explains why it barely fits.  i'm not returning the band because i will be giving it to my daughter, but it's definitely too short for me.
first off, my order came from china. received the shipment within the 4-8 week window. i purchased both the 6 pack 38mm and 6 pack 42mm watch bands of various colors. 5 of the bands would not lock into the watches. 3 on the 42mm bunch and 2 from the 38mm bunch. i am disappointed of this fact. it would have cost me less time and money if i had just ordered the bands individually, with the colors that i wanted. i did like the feel of the band fabric as it was soft and comfortable to wear all day. too bad the substandard quality of connectors have spoiled this review. paying $60 for 12 bands total is a good deal, if they all worked and were not defective. however, if i had the opportunity to choose colors, i would prefer that. 42% of my order is unusable so i have thrown away ~$25.

i was on the fence deciding whether to purchase this or not. it had about 4.2 stars overall. i thought it couldn’t be that bad....but it just arrived and it’s pretty bad.  very poor quality and fit.  both the band and the mounting piece are inferior...the band is not terrible but it doesn’t really matter because the mounting pieces that slide into the watch are simply unworkable.  i virtually never write poor reviews but this was just too poor to let go.
this is a nice band. the color is the exact black i wish apple would make. unfortunately, it is too small to fit my wrist well.
unfortunately, the plastic end that attaches to the watch where the strap slides through has a gap that is too wide for the strap width. this causes the watch to often look a tad crooked on my wrist.
while i like the color, comfort and construction of the band, the 42mm is not big enough for those who have larger wrists and make it very difficult to safely secure the band without worrying it will come undone.  also, one of the sides that connects to the apple watch itself slides back and forth as if the magnetic connection is not completely secure.  i tried several different times and was to see if it was user error but it just seems to be either a defect on the one i received or maybe how they are made.  while it still seems to hold the watch on and in place, the movement was enough to give me pause when using the band for fear of the watch coming out.  while it is a good, cheap nylon sport band, i cannot recommend it for anyone who has either large wrists or is paranoid about their watch following off because of bad magnet connections.
putting on and taking off the band is difficult compared to the other three i have purchased.  the band is too thick if you need to open it to its widest setting which involves passing the band through the hook pads at the end.  haven’t had this issue with my other bands.  by the way, what happened to my previous review of this product.
the watch band is decent for the money, but can be a pain to get to lock into place on your watch.  it took probably 10 minutes of taking the band off and on until it locked in place properly.
not impressed. i have not seen the actual apple version but this band is very narrow. almost like it is made for the 38mm but they just put wider slides on the end to fit the 42mm apple watch. looks really bad on since it is so narrow compared to the watch.
i ordered one of these after getting an official nike/apple sport loop in olive green for xmas and liking it. i was disappointed when i got this qiengo band, though, because the end that the nylon goes through would not click in to my watch (i.e. it would just slide through, even during normal movements of my wrist). i had to return the band, as it was non-functional like that.
didn't realize this was a velco "lock". it held, but i was a bit skeptical for daily use.
a little thicker and about inch shorter than a similar band i have from amband.  the nylon weave on the inside that touches my inner wrist also isn't as smooth and makes me itch.  won't be buying another from this brand.
the quality of the band is pretty good. one major flaw is that it is not nearly as wide as the apple brand sport loop and looks starnge when attached to your watch and on your wrist. would be ok for a young person or a child with thin wrists. i'm returning mine and hope to find another manufacturer that would have the proper width.
quality seems good, but the width of the band is narrower than the 42mm apple branded one so it looks/wears weird to the point i won't wear.  since it doesn't take up the full width of the lug opening, my guess is they wanted to use the same band for both 38 and 42 mm versions so you end up with a narrow one for 42mm.
lugs are loose in the watch. lug slot is quite a bit larger than the band so it gets distorted where it loops back.  band also received slightly deformed.
i have been very happy with the band for the month i have had it, but i am disappointed it is already starting to break away at the connection point. this is with normal wear and tear, nothing out of the ordinary.
band itself looks good.  one minor issue is that the connectors do not match the apple watch color.  another is that the loop on the top face of the watch does not fit in its own connector.  these are the bands that look good from a distance but once you are up close or wearing it for yourself the annoyances build and build...
the band ismade well and feels comfortable but appearance-wise it is unsatisfactory. the material is so thick that the loop does notlay flat and shows a pretty big separation where it loops around.
i’ve had mine for 3+ months now. for the price, it’s a no brainer. if you really want your band to have a perfect(band to body) fit then give apple the 50$. if you want something that works ok day in, day out for under 15$, buy this and be done. peace.
pretty good replica but noticeably thinner than the original 42mm sport loop that came with my watch. it’s a good buy for the price and would be perfect if it was the right size.
it holds the watch securely, but the velcro on it is a bit thick so it can be difficult to expand the band out to it’s maximum width.
the velcro isn't as good as apple original, and the band is slightly narrower. it's not bad for the money but don't expect it to be as good as the bands that come on the watch from apple.
ended up getting an authentic apple strap instead. this is not an exact replica in case you’re wondering.
wish the velcro wouldn't get caught up in the sleeve  loop otherwise i'd give this 5 product 5 stars.
this item is cheap and should be sold at a dollar store.  i didn’t even bother paying for return.  i just threw it in the garbage where it belong.
you get what you pay for i guess.  this is no where near the quality of apple bands and the price reflects that.  i wouldn't by it again, the quality seems just ok and i'm guessing it's going to wear pretty quick.  i would not buy this again and regretting my purchase.
decent quality band but the thing that i dislike about it is that where the band connects to the watch seems to slide out every know and then. it seems the threshold between the connection is off a bit and that is why it slides out.
i have to  disconnect the band in order to charge my watch because of the loop
wouldn't stay together.  i don't know if i received a faulty one but it kept coming off of the watch face itself.  didn't wear it out of the house... or even longer than 5 minutes because i was afraid it would fall off and i would lose the watch.
stiff material. feed through slot too narrow for any of the velcro hooks so could not open the band far enough to get my not very large hand through the  loop. i have returned the band.
does not fit securely in the slots on the watch.  the straps wiggle and move around, making me feel like it’s going to slide off at any moment.
