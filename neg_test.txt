band will not stay “snapped” and continually comes loose/undone. almost dropped my apple watch when it came undone walking. will be returning to amazon.
i am disappointed that the color that i picked is not what arrived. even more so confused that the package clearly states pink/white but it’s black/white. as far as the quality of the band for $7 i’m not complaining. it would just have been nice to get the right color that i wanted.
this product had black ink on the band that wouldn’t come off when i tried to clean it. so it looked used & dirty.
fits loosely, quality is pretty bad wouldn't buy again. the black dots are not consistent on the watchband and easily snaps off when trying to fit it on wrist. try another one.
i wore it one time, took it off and it broke. very disappointing!
terrible! literally when putting it on for the first time the little knob broke off. definitely  would not recommend
this is the 3rd time the watchband has disconnected from the watch while
it appeared that it would have a white plastic piece that would go around the watch face and cover the rose gold but it did not
loved the colors of this band and its many sizing options but i’ve it less than one week and it has already broken.
i got larger size and while ordering this they didn't game ma choice for m /  l
broke on the 3rd use....
the band was broke in somes zones
didn’t fit my apple watch and felt like i was going to mess up my watch when i tried to use this.
great price, loved the colors and everything but left two burn spots on my wrist from each end of the band. loosened to see if it was just rubbing to much and it got worse.
definitely not what i was expecting you can feel the material is really cheap
when product arrived band was broken. was unable to get band to clip or snap into place due to one small piece being broken on it.
poor quality
didn't fit my wrist
this item bothered my wrist my wrist got very itchy and red bumps were starting to form waste of money.
didn't even last a week.
this product is very cheaply made very thin i’m returning i’m very disappointed
the band wouldnt attach to the watch face the way its displayed. its backwards and unusable!
it wasn’t the correct size
solicite este producto como es mostrado en la imagen black y me llego gris oscuro con los hoyos en negro.
let me first say that this band looks like a clone of the original nike apple bands. it holds well, fits well, and is flexible. i haven't had it come off once and it's been the main band i wear. my issue lies in the fact that the white band that i purchased slowly has become discolored. it seems that the parts of the band that lay underneath the rest of the watch when it's on are becoming peach/tan/orange. i have tried to clean this off to no avail. i use this band to play golf and to work so maybe sweat is discoloring it? i'm not sure, but it's a silicone band and should be plenty resistant to this sort of behavior. i intended to give this 5 stars but am truly disappointed with the discoloring. i guess if you buy a dark color, this is likely not to happen. thanks for reading my review!
the band broke where you clasp it together after 2 days. save your money
do not buy this product. the band feels very cheap material.. not worth the money!
i wish i could review, but my package was empty!!
band is too wide for series 4
cheep looking was missing a  peace on the band
horrible chemical smell. returning.
not navy.  it is a violet color
didn’t like it at all  ... it does  click  one of the band fall
don’t waste your money... fall apart after 1 day wearing
this band lasted me 3 weeks and broke. i do not recommend
the band was broken as soon as i opened it! do not buy
broke after two weeks of wear. very comfy but not durable.
broke before i could even get both bands on!!
38 not 42
awful.  broke after 2 wears
the metal part was sticking out too much where i couldn't insert it into my apple watch 2.  also the black rubber holes weren't cut or drilled out completely so there are residues left over.  when you look through the red watch band, the black rubber holes are weird looking rather than what you see on the picture.
disappointed in color.  i order white/black and it’s no where near white. looks more tan or beign. it’s still pretty color, but they don’t need to say it’s white because it isn’t.  now i got to find another one that’s true white.
the product description says the clasp is stainless steel, but it definitely isn’t. it is a very cheap metal (probably contains nickel) that caused me severe skin irritation. the apple band that came with my watch also has a stainless steel clasp and it doesn’t irritate my skin at all. if you are sensitive to metals, order a different brand!
i liked the feel and fit of this band, but i’ve worn it for about 4 weeks and it fell apart. i can’t get the button back in, and even if i could i imagine it would just continue to fall off. unfortunately, my return window closed last week so i’m pretty disappointed.
i would give it a negative review if i could, it left a horrible burn like rash on my wrist. i thought i was wearing it too tight, the rash came back even after i started wearing it looser. don't buy it
quality isn't there; should have surmised that based on the cost.
used once and broke.
cheap metal gave me a skin rash on the clasp
it broke within two day!
when i received the band, the silver button where the straps clasp together was broken down the middle. the crack ran down to the base of the button. i am returning right after opening.
this band was very cheap. the minute i put the band on my watch it broke and it wouldn’t stay on my wrist.
one part is impossible  fixed to the watch, it just felt.
would give zero stars if possible clasp broke instantly from first use
broke within a month of use. bought 2, the second one broke a less than a day into use
nice looking but already breaking apart after two weeks of use.
this item is verry cheap quality poor
it was broken !
i was excited to wear the new band which i did today and unfortunately i have to return it. i did wear the band one day and after i took my watch off i had a rash around where the band was on my hand. today was a rest day of exercise and no sweaty rist and still i got my had all cover with rash.
the band is nice and soft. the only thing that i have a problem is the connection. it’s not holding in properly. i just received it and the band looks like it’s going to come out of the iwatch grove. it could be a defective item. but i’m afraid that it will come apart and my iwatch will fall off my wrist. going to put my original band on
ordered navy and pink, recieved blue and neon green
item is not white as described in the photo, it is more of a cream color. the metal post is also starting to rust. only wore it for the last week. would not recommend.
purchased this band, loved how it looked and fit. ripped after one day of use and is no longer wearable :(
wore the band for one day and it broke, sending it back.
band was great right away. but now it is starting to rip already. not very pleased with how soon it started to happen.
band was defective. unable to attach to the actual watch, causing it to fall from wrist and break. i have a hole and cracks in the screen of my watch.
well i thought i liked this band but after only one month (naturally just after return window has closed). this is about to break
i have ordered all kinds of silicone bands for my apple watch and this one the metal part made my skin break out.
band is more narrow than oem band in this same style.  the closure is also opposite of that shown in photo.
let me say when these came in the mail i was impressed with their looks for the price.  everything ended there.
product as described quality is not as good just average cheap bands
i bought this product one month ago. the band already is ripped and falling apart. poor quality. can i please get my money back or a new one.
i ordered the white/black band.  the band that i received is not what i expected and does not match the color in the product image.  i have attached a picture of my white band next to the "white/black" band that i received...  in my opinion it is ugly.  i am returning this product.
ordered this item and all i received was an empty package!!
i would give this product no stars if i could. i bought this and wore it for about a month but then the band started to break down. i noticed a red mark on my wrist but thought nothing of it. then my husband wore this and made his skin peel!!! do not buy this!!!
feels very cheap and looks cheap :( was expecting better!
package even says black and white and it is navy.
tried to use the band for the first time and one of the ends does not fit properly.  wasted my money.
purchased this less than a month ago and the middle strand broke off yesterday and the jewel pieces went flying. the rubber strand that is used must be too thin for day to day use so buyer beware.  occasional use only!!!! 
i got the watch onto the band no problem. it's really cute and sparkly and exactly what i was looking for.
there is rubber string hanging out from in between the beads. the "pearl" like beads are peeling :(
the bands came twisted and it was very small. sad because it's pretty. returned.
does not fit my small wrist and for a heavy watch it should be snug fitting so as not to bump it into things.
the info says it fits wrists 5.7'- 6.9', but that is not  true.  the bracelet measures 5 inches.  my wrist is 6 inches and it is not comfortable, it is too fitted.
i loved the look and feel of this band.  so pretty but have had for 4 months and worn it infrequently because i alternate bands. today my watch almost was lost because a pin came loose and was lost.  i took band to jeweler to see if he could fix it since i had the pins but not the screw.  he said he get's these questions all the time and does not have the screws to fix it.  if the company sends me a new band or screws i i will update my review but this is the 2nd time this has happened and i've had it.
gave as a gift to my mother, fell apart after only two weeks.  one of the elastic bands was cut thru causing several beads to be lost. it appeared one of the decorative pieces on the elastic band was sharp and rubbed until it cut thru.  very disappointing.
this band is pretty however a day after the return limit my band started to fall apart!! i think they are made of very cheap rubber bands. ultra thin string. this is the second band made of the cheap cheap stuff i’ve been ripped off on.
terrible. it broke the minute i put it on my wrist.
i ordered this band at the end of july, here it  is not even 2 months that i have had it and the rubber inside the beads is starting to rip apart and hang outside of the beads.  pretty but not worth the price they are asking.  i only wear my watch 5 days a week and do not work in construction... this should be a lot sturdier than what it is.
it did come on time.. however the product is defeated, the band is all crossed up.which make the band hurt the arm, because it's not laying correctly. this is my second band so i know how it should fit as well as be.
one of the strand of heads broke when i was putting it on for the first time.
super cute and looks great! only downfall is i have small wrists and there is no way to adjust the band. if i wear it my watch doesn't register that it's on my wrist and makes me miss notifications.
i literally had this for a month and it busted when i went to put it on one day and the beads went everywhere...  very disappointed
really cute but the eslastic is really easy to break...soneasy, it came damaged. definitely not a cute every day, maybe for special occasions for a few hours.
after wearing this band for 8 days, the band broke. i kept seeing little black strings sticking out every so often, and i would just cut them off. well little did i know that was the elastic stings breaking off. it’s a pretty band, but is not made well. don’t waste your money, unless you want to pay $18 for something that will last a week.
i absolutely love this watchband.  it was exactly wat i was looking for, unfortunately one one the three band broke when i was taking it off the first time i wore it.  i’m not sure it it was because two on the bands were crossed making the middle band more vulnerable and tighter but the rubber snapped.  this is such a beautiful band i just with it was more than a rubber band holding it together.  i had to return it for a refund though i was considering taking another chance and replacing it.  😢
broke after one use
i loved the band at first.  many many compliment's on it.  i really liked the way it sat just right on my wrist.  i did not wear the band fr more than 2 weeks and it broke. i will not buy this again ever
super tiny
loved the idea - hate the product and wasted money!!!  just realized my return deadline was yesterday!  do not waste your money.
lost an itty bitty screw and fell apart after 2 days. sad, because i did find it pretty. returning this
this order came broken
the band got stuck and i couldn't get it off! i know that it will cost as much as i a paid for the band.  third party vendors suck!
if i could give a zero, i would! i was so excited for this watch band. i measured my wrist and was so sure it would fit! i received the band and immediately put it on my watch, slid it over my wrist, and a strap broke! not even one wear! so sad and disappointed! beads went everywhere and so did my hopes for this watch band.
broken after just months beads all over the place almost lost my watch
i wore it for 5 minutes, not even and the middle beaded part broke. in the process of returning.
doesn’t fit my wrist but not sellers fault, it is cute but would return but they will charge 5.99 to ship back, in good
after alot of searching, i was so happy to decide on this band. i tried it on, loved it- i went to take it off, one of the bands broke and that was the end of this bracelet. really disappointing since i wasn't being aggressive. i assume most reviews are from when they are brand new because i now can't imagine this band lasting very long.
chinsy and cheaply made. was pretty while it lasted..
i was so excited to get this band and have something a little more classy and upscale for work. it arrived on thursday and i put the band on my iwatch immediately. friday morning, i went to put the watch on and the elastic band snapped and the beads fell to the floor. didn't even last a day! i am so disappointed!
i bought this band because it is so pretty but it is so tight i can’t stand it!  a screwdriver comes on the box but the elastic bands are actually tied on.  no screw to unscrew!  i’m pretty sure i have waited too long to return it so i may consider giving it to my daughter since she has a smaller wrist.  very disappointed!!!
love the look & feel of this watch band & get lots of compliments on it but it does not hold up.  orders on in february- it broke in may.  got a new one & it broke after 2 months.  i don’t wear watch every day imagine if i did, it would last o let a month.  elastic stretches & out breaks.  not worth the investment
it's falling apart just days after getting it
cute item but it doesn’t last. i only use it for special outing which totals to about 5 to 7 days since i’ve had it and the bracelet is already damaged.
broken immediately
i got it for my birthday and at first it was tight uncomfortable and itchy. i thought i need time to get used to it and in two weeks the color and beads started coming off then one day it popped really disappointed.
the box the band comes in has higher quality than the band it self.  i received it yesterday and returned it today, a stand broke and beads went everywhere and the band would not lock in place on one side.
received product on july 13 already two elastic bands broke
strings were hanging out of the beads. as soon as i tried to put it on my wrist, the string broke and beads flew everywhere. i’ll be returning this.
band broke after wearing it about 5 times.
beautiful look but after only wearing it for a few weeks it has stretched and now the band and my watch keep circling around my wrist :(
broke easily and beads fell off, disappointed.
not satisfied at all. gave the watch band to my daughter on christmas eve and it is already broke. wouldn’t recommend this product.
i just now went to put this band on my apple watch and it’s missing a magnetic piece so it won’t stay attached to my watch. now it’s too late to return so i won’t be using it
it’s nice, but it was too tight and uncomfortable. the band also got stuck in my apple watch and i had to use extreme force to get it out. i will be returning it.
i loved my watch band at first but after the 1st month it is too stretched out. some of the rubber bands are starting to fray and break.
very pretty but not at all durable. mine broke after only one month of use spilling beads all over the floor. elastic thread easily breaks and is not repairable.
i loved this band and got so many compliments on it, but sadly it just fell apart and broke after 6 months.
band snapped the first week.
the bead color wears off almost immediately. the ornamental hanging beads were lost almost immediately. i would not buy it agaon
it is pretty and the profile said that it could be adjusted. however, there are no instructions and i can't find anything online yet. it comes with a tool, so i assume that it can be adjusted. please someone, assist me!
it’s so tight it cuts into my wrist. if you have a smaller wrist it would be perfect for you. i wish they came in different sizes.
the watch band was very cute and i loved it. i did not love that after 3 days the elastic holding the beads together began to shred and break. thank goodness for amazon’s return policy.
the attachments that slide into the watch are made of plastic and seem flimsy.  also, it was tight on my wrist.
had a nice look but it broke the next day. the elastic strings aren’t durable at all!! beads everywhere!
junk! got this as a christmas gift put it on for the first time and within an hour one of the strands broke off and the beads went everywhere and i was driving nothing had even touched it.
cheaply made
not worth the purchase! it broke and fell apart in 2 days of wear
i loved it ... til it broke after less than a week!!! and just while out with a friend to lunch. no hard wear and tear.
my wife loved this watch bracelet but it has no durability.  this was the 2nd one purchased after the first one did the same exact thing.
beautiful band, lots of compliments. 1st elastic string busted after 3 weeks. ordered a 2nd one and same string busted after 2weeks.
my item was broken when i received it. otherwise beautiful but unusable.
i had to return this purchase. i got the biggest size and it was still too tight. my wrists are normal i think so i was rather disappointed
broke the second time i put it on. looked down at watch and one strand busted and half the beads fell off.
pierde el brillo de inmediato
loved this product, but only downfall is the item broke the 2nd time i tried to put it on. which is why it only received one star
i just use twice and one string broke
middle beads totally broke into pieces. i am extremely dissatisfied with the product.
not what it seems
discolored my wrist as the beads paint wore off. wouldn't buy again. than the elastic broke
coming apart already.  i watches are to expensive to risk this item  i want to return and get a refund
color fades to quick..and the little ball that hangs on there always falls off..this is my second one..
it was easy to install. unfortunately, i got it on the 23 of july, it’s now august 1st and busted. feeling ripped off.
broke in less than a month minimum wear
this was purchased as a gift for my wife. after putting it on, she said it was too tight. so we tried to remove it. one side came off easy. the other side had to be removed by visiting an apple store and have 3 of their people remove the second half without damaging the watch body. that is total nonsense, and not acceptable in any way. do not buy this band. you risk wrist pain, and watch damage.
fell apart after wearing for just a week.
as soon as it came i slid one side in to my apple watch and the whole band broke. i immediately returned it
felt to tight . couldn't wear it.
loved the band at first but it already popped on me.
this was already broken. the piece was nowhere to be found in the box
my watch band already broke and it’s not even a month old! disappointed!
broke within 2 minutes of taking it out of the box.
hate it not cute at all
when i received this item it was broken!
pretty band but, the band broke the day it arrived. what a waste of money. do not buy!
it broke on the second day i had it on. not durable at all.
the paint is peeling and the string and coming unraveled
ugly and poor quality.
it broke the second time i put it on
doesn’t stay on!!! and i would like a refund since it was a gift for christmas but it won’t let me
this band broke with in two days not worth the money at all.
fell apart quickly
super cute but i only got to wear it 4 times before one of the strands of beads broke :(
my package wrapper arrived with nothing in the envelope. i have no product at all.
it’s very pretty but it don’t stretch enough
so cute but the band is made of material that quickly frayed so i was unable to wear
great band style wise. i received plenty of compliments but it’s broke already.
it broke after a week but i love the product. need replacement.
it broke after wearing it a few times.
no received the goods ,the packet were is empety.
very pretty, but i've had it less than a month and it is broke.
had to return it too small felt like it would break.
it broke
the package was empty upon arrival.  top of package was completely open.
cute band
was too wide for watch. also was too big.
plastic band busted after 2 weeks
much to small
the beaded strands are twisted from side to side.
i really loved this band, but after wearing it for less than two weeks one of the links that attaches to where you insert the watch band broke. i was very disappointed and was hoping that it would have lasted a little longer.
if you have a small wrist, don't get this. it doesn't keep the watch snug against your wrist so it keeps locking, if you have a passcode on your watch.
we couldn’t decide if it looks like something a 10 year old would wear or a 90 year old, but either way it looks cheap and gaudy at the same time. maybe i should have looked closer but i wasn’t expecting it to be covered in cheap looking rhinestones all over where it attaches to the watch. i returned it immediately.
broke within a week!  after a couple days wearing it, i began noticing elastic fibers sticking out in random spots.  then yesterday at work one band broke completely.  needs much stronger elastic for metal beads.  very disappointed
lots of complements on this band and loved it but i knew as soon as i opened it that it would be short lived.  it lasted exactly eight weeks before the end broke in half.
don’t order. this is a rip off! pretty but not functional unless it fits your wrist snug. it turns around and you end up initiating functions on your watch by rubbing it against something. i tried to return and even though i am prime it costs almost as much as the band cost originally to pay for the return!!! not good:(
elastic broke the first day i wore it
interesting and unusual but only lasted a week before one of the strands of beads broke, and only about 5 days before the metal portions started leaving dark marks on my skin. total junk. don’t waste your money.
one of the chains broke the same day i got it.. definitely not stretchy if ur wrist is a tiny bit bigger. i went to michaels and bought things to fix it, but it takes patience. it’s really pretty once fixed.
not worth it cheap elastic
love my watch band it’s gorgeous, love the way it looks but it broke already wish it would of lasted more . it lasted like two weeks.
as so on as i tried it placing it on the watch it broke ñ. i was so disappointed since i really liked it. i was not able to use it.
very cheap quality, the strings started coming out after 2 days
broke withing a week.
it broke after 1 day of light wear....was purchased as a birthday gift.
pretty but was broken right out of the box!  very disappointed.
had the band on for one hour and it broke....returned
loved this band .. but i only wore it twice and it broke. disappointed
broke after a few wears.
band broke a week after receiving it. no replacement yet.
it’s very grandma-ish. not a fan
this is so beautiful! i wasn't super picky about the original apple watch band but sometimes you just need a little sparkle in your life. i was originally concerned that it would be too loose for the heart monitor to work on the watch but was pleasantly surprised that while it is snug it is not overly tight or overly loose. my wrist is wrist where this sits is 6 3/4 inches.
i liked the look of this band but it was constantly slipping off of my wrist with no way to tighten. plus a week ago (two weeks after my purchase) it completely broke! please take my advice and do not waste your money on this item!!!
the band itself is very cute, but beware if you have small wrists. even though i measured my wrist prior to buying it, and according to the measurements it should have fit, it was still way too big on me. highly disappointed with the seller. i had to pay almost $10 to return it since they would not pay for my return. not buying from this seller again.
poor experience with them.  band got stuck and needs to have apple store remove it.  after two attempts explaining situation,  did not resolve.
i love the watch band so much, it’s absolutely beautiful, but it literally snapped and broke... i was walking and suddenly hear beads falling to the floor, and one of the elastics was just hanging and beads everywhere on the ground. i gathered what i could find, but it seems impossible to fix it. i hate that i have to rate it like this since i adore the band, but with it just suddenly snapping like that... i’m afraid the other two elastics will now snap as well and my expensive watch with fall to the ground and break.
came with a broken string. beads fell out when it was picked up.
this item was purchased as a gift for christmas and within exactly one month, the band has shredded and the dangle has fallen off.  while the product is beautiful it is only good for appearance not to actually wear.  i would not recommand purchasing this item
this thing is not cute! i went back immediately.
loved it when i received it. wore it twice and threw packaging away. when i was wearing it it second time, it literally fell apart!  thank goodness i was sitting at the time and my watch fell in my lap. do not recommend. not sure if i’ll be able to return since i threw all packaging away. guess i’ll see.
i really enjoyed wearing this band on special occasions; however, i recently attempted to switch my sports band to the tomazon fashion band and it literally fell apart in my hand.  how disappointing.  i didn't expect it to last forever, but i thought it would for at least a year or so since i didn't use it as an everyday band.
i wanted so much to love this. it's so pretty! however, when i wore it my battery died in about 6 hours.  i'm guessing since the band is loose and the watch doesn't come in contact with your arm at all times, the battery runs down quicker.  i couldn't even make it through a work day with it. :(
this band is beautiful and looks great but....it broke the second time it was worn.  beads flew all over and that was the end of it!
it ran kinda tight. and very cheap looking.
i received the band yesterday 12/30/17 and the band snapped putting on the same day it's not a sturdy band
i bought this watch band 2 months ago and really loved it. i have worn it a dozen times at the most. today one of the strands broke. too bad! this is a pretty watch band, but of poor quality.
it did not work. it would slide into one side of my watch but not the other. if you tried to force it, it just got stuck.
i think this is a super cute apple watch band. unfortunately, after only owning it for a month, one of the elastics has broken and some of the paint on the grey beads is worn off. very disappointed 😔
this is very small. it fits but it’s so tight, it’s very uncomfortable. this would be best for someone with a really skinny wrist.
this would have been great if the beads weren’t so cheap that they peeled a week after wearing it. i don’t wear my watch in water, have a desk job, and take it off at night. the book was really cute for a professional or formal setting, but now i can’t even wear it.
i finally changed out my watch strap and wore it twice and one of the strings broke very disappointing
the bracelet broke on the second day of me wearing it. the metal bracket that holds the side to the part that attaches to the iwatch broke.
this product arrived in a timely manner. i ordered the correct size, but it was extremely tight and there were strings coming out from the band. yesterday it finally broke and the beads fell everywhere, and apparently it is 6 days too late to return. i would like my money back, this product was not made well.
this is hey second added review. the item broke today. they should’ve used heavier duty string
i've only worn this a few times and the elastic is fraying.  i wish i could return it.
one of the strings broke and the beads fell off on the fifth time i wore the band. all five times i wore it were to special events and i did not do a whole lot of movement. very disappointed how it held up because it was very cute.
waste of money. the middle strand broke for no reason.  don't waste your money!
too small and feel rash after wearing it.
this product was awful! as soon as i started to wear it, it immediately started to unravel. i will be returning this and getting a refund. i will never purchase this type of watchband ever again.
returned. way to big for my wrist.
satisfied however when you stretch it the knots shows. after using it for one week it breaks for no reason. very cheap. waste of money. do not buy!
look nice but fall apart.
would give a negative 5 for customer support :(
horrible. band snapped within 2 wears.
i dislike this product as i ordered 42mm and it was so uncomfortably tight that’s i have never worn it
love this and got lots of compliments but it broke after 1 1/2 month which was too late to return and seller did not respond to my request.
i loved the look, hated that it could not withstand normal wear and tear. after about a month of wear, it started to fall apart.
beautiful bracelet, but broke already! i bought it mid january and i already had to throw it out. the strings for the bracelet snapped and all the beads came tumbling down. disappointed
beautiful band but already coming apart. not durable at all!!
was able to wear the band a few times before the link to the iwatch broke
mine broke already did have it a month
i loved the look of this band but half way though he day it was cutting off my circulation. so sad because it does dress up the watch and was beautiful.
the band did not even last 2 weeks before one of the straps broke and sent beads everywhere.  my wife thought it looked nice, but that doesn’t matter if it can’t last.
had to return. beads were twisted
do not buy this.
i bought this band and it was beautiful!  after two days it fell apart. cheaply made.
the little stands inside the band started breaking the first time i put it on, was one very pleased with the quality of the product.
it’s too big and the worst part is that i bought two and now i can’t return when i put it on the face of the watch is a lot heavier and i’m afraid of breaking my watch
highly unsatisifed it came broken in the package i never got to use it
thought it was beautiful when i bought it, but now 2 months later it is stretched out and broken, very disappointed
my watch band broke and i’ve only had it 4 or 5 days!!
i was missing a screw and it wouldn't fit in the watch slip for the band
i got tons of compliments on this band however the band broke three weeks after purchase..
i love love love the design but i have very tiny wrists so it dangles and doesn’t keep my watch in place
didn’t even make it a month without coming apart! casing is plastic!
it was cute until it broke
does not lock onto my apple watch
some of the beads fell off the first hour.  the remaining beads have held up a while
this product broke with in a month
bead charm wasn’t attached
update 12/26/17
too big for my wrist. no way to adjust
looks cheap. not worth the money.
wore it for 5 days (1work week) and then on friday when i went to remove it the whole thing burst. beads went flying everywhere and my very scared puppy hid. seriously, don’t spend the money and expect this to last. at all. very disappointed.
poorly constructed
my charm fell off same day & it broke on the 2nd day i'm so hurt i loved it!!
ripped strings everywhere already cut 10 off so pictures don’t do justice.... too small for large wrists cut off circulation
outer band broke within the first week of wearing it. poorly constructed.
bought on may 2018 and the part that connects  to the watch has broken already. very in happy.
wore it for the very first time today - nothing special, just a wedding. it broke as i took it off. very disappointed bc it’s super cute.
the product was bought as a gift for a friend. the gift lasted about a month until one day the band randomly broke off at the edge nearly shattering the watch face when hitting the concrete. the band looked great however, paired to hold such a pricey watch - it doesn’t do its job correct and i’d never recommend it to anyone.
i received the product wednesday it’s broken on friday.. very cheaply made
horrible it comes apart on the first day of putting on
i only used the band for 3 days and on the third day i was sitting down and out of nowhere my watch just fell, the band had broke from one side and i was literally doing nothing
so disgusting!  product arrived in an old, wet, moldy box with a rusty small phillips head screw driver inside!
didn’t last long . popped in 3 months
i really like the braclet, however it broke off my arm in 20 mins of driving.  basically, i can not tell you why.  the braclet fit good on and look nice.  however i purchased it for my iwatch and the piece that connect to the iwatch broke.  i will not try this again
wouldn’t you know, my band broke 2 days after the return window expired! so, i’m left with a unusable item that i now have to by something else to replace.
disappointed that it didn’t even last a week. after wearing it for 5 days the metal screw flew off and the band fell apart.
to begin with, am not someone who writes bad reviews; if i don't like something i bought, i just stop using the product and don't recommend to others. in this case i feel a social responsibility to let others know my experience. i bought this band  and was very happy with it for the entire first month of use. recently i started experiencing a lot of itching on my hand around the area where i put on my watch. since yesterday that area became red (see attached picture). the doctor said it's probably because of the sweat caused by the band, i never had this issue on the original band which came with the watch and i have been using it since more than an year.
for all of 8 hours i was fully satisfied with this product. it looked good and felt good on your wrist. while returning to my car, i heard a noise and when i looked, there is my watch on the ground. pin came apart from the part that slides into the watch. it keeps doing this.
the watch band once you receive it looks nice, it's in a great package, fits very well on the watch. but.....after wearing it for a whole year it is not durable, it cracks, you can not go for a walk in the sun because it discolors quickly. it was breaking apart and i'm a person that would only wear it for special occasions hear and their.  i work in an office and i thought that this was going to be my work band and everyday i would take it off and it would flake, crack, and the cracks would get dirty and when your tried to clean it, it would just get worst. personally, this band was not worth it. i usually hate writing product reviews but this product was not what i expected. i also, do not write my reviews until i had some time with the product which has been more than a year and its not meant to be worn everyday or for work. hope this helped. **one time wear.
i really liked it for about a week, but it didn't take long for the band to wear away. maybe i would have had better luck with a different color. white was a terrible choice.
my daughter has had this band for 4 months now. already the loops the band goes through have broken leaving the band useless. the stitching is frayed all over the band. it looks absolutely horrible. would definitely not recommend this product to anyone looking to get longevity out of a watch band:
the leather itself is lovely. the hardware needs improvement. i bought two of these, green and red. the green watchband kept coming apart. i don't have the dexterity to keep inserting the little spring loaded catch into the small opening. besides it only comes out again. the red band does not lock on one of its sides. i'm asking for full refund.
poor quality. hinges that connect band to piece that connects to the watch kept breaking apart so i couldn't even tighten the band or put it on without it breaking at the hinges.
didn’t like. really ugly color yellow. returned.  sorry!  not the best quality either.  just doesn’t look like nice leather.  didn’t like at all.
i love the purple color and wish it had held up better (pictures attached).  i wear it daily, i don’t swim or shower with it.  i am bummed that the leather is cracking and the color is coming off.  it has to be replaced and wish it lasted longer.
thought i was getting a deal, and just got what i paid for. it’s a functional band, but the quality is terrible
band would not slide onto the watch. had to return to vendor.
i really liked the look and feel of this band. but it falls off!!!  i’m soooo angry! it fell off my wrist and my apple watch screen is damaged!!!! this band can not be trusted!!!!!!!
it might be a great band, but i didn’t receive it. all i received was an empty white box with the seal already broken on it. sadly disappointed after i looked forever trying to decide which band i wanted from the hundreds available.
totally flimsy...metal contacts where strap is inserted broke as soon as i put it in!!
very stiff feeling. doesn’t feel like real leather.
the description explained how high of quality this band was and i already had to order a new band in about a month because the leather started to chip and one of the little bands that holds the excess band down completely broke off and the other one is about to break as well. wouldn't recommend this and won't buy again. going back to the silicone bands. 😞
i just bought two and they look really nice and the leather is soft, but rattle around in their sockets in the watch and i don’t trust a $400 watch to a band that rattles any time i move my hand. i’m concerned about the lock mechanism being unreliable. i likely won’t use them.
the paint was peeling after two weeks but i couldnt get clear pictures to send to seller. now after over two months i have them.  cute but bad quality
broken upon delivery. does not work as it should. scary to use since expensive watch
the material of the band is really bad,  even the lock doesn't stay closed, this product is a waste of money.
watchband was torn out of the box
i’ve only had this band for a few months and it just broke. very disappointed. i did love it. really nice but it needs to last longer.
the pin that held the band in place fell out and watch fell off my hand, i was not aware that i lost it until i was walking back to my vehicle saw the watch on the ground, good thing no one else found it nor get run over by vehicle.  it was dark and rainy that night, only had band for 4 months now i’m stuck with it.  :(
worst band i've ever bought. it broke the night that i got it. do not buy this band.
the watch pin kept popping out. i will not be wearing this as i don't want to lose my watch because of an ill-fitting band.
put it on and the link started to pull away from watch.
within 3 months, both of the keepers broke off and the whole band broke off of the watch. this watch is on my 21 year old daughter who is not hard on anything.
disappointing.  the leather is stitched with fishing line.  there is a end sticking up which sticks in my skin and is very uncomfortable.
band did not snap into place correctly so i would steer clear
i ordered several bands for my apple watch and this one didnt fit correctly.  when you put the watch on it pulls away frim the watch.  im afraid to wear it fearing it may come off and the watch will fall off.
does not feel like leather. i’m returning asap
buckle hurts your wrist it does not lay flat
very plastic look
looks way too chunky on my wrist and eliminates the sleek look of the watch in general, as it is pretty much the same width of the face. wore it a couple weeks and it's now in a drawer.
i love the design. looks sharp. however this morning when i put the watch on part of the band has broken (see picture). i've only owned the product for less than 5 days and already broken.
very thin, and a synthetic leather is seems
didn’t like the look or feel.
the band came broken. the magnetic piece on the connector isn't flush so it won't fit on my watch. i'm really disappointed because the straps look really nice.
just ordered and don't like it. the band is too stiff and doesn't fit right.  it would cost you $5.99 to return so not even worth returning.  you wouldn't get most of your money back anyway!
ripped after 2 days of use. returned
i really wanted to like this band. i tried it on two separate occasions for full day(s) wear. it felt cheaply made and hurt my wrist i had to switch back to my original apple band. i'm keeping this only because it's not free returns and i would be losing $6 for shipping when i only paid $10 for the product.
most disappointed with these two. this is so not leather at all, they look like foam. please return my money back.looks cheap, not as advertised. money back would also be ideal as i leave abroad and shipping back will cost more than de item.
way too bulky
didnt like the leather look. not what i expected. it looks super cheap. what a waste of money. im disappointed.
same issue as others have described....one of the connectors will not stay connected or "locked" to the watch.  otherwise, it had the potential to be a nice band.
very upset, i was excited for this band but once it arrived and i went too switch my bands out this product would not lock into my apple watch sport series 1
after only 3 weeks of wear the white has already started to peel off.
fell apart from my wife's wrist. apple watch dropped on floor...luckily no damage. really disappointed..
this is not a good quality watch band. after just a month the material started to peel away and looked awful. i definitely do not recommend this product.
item was very nice but broke within two months of occasional use. the pin holding the metal hoop to the band came out and is not easy enough to reinsert again yourself.
low quality
the band is nice but the color is kind of ugly in person
the original packing, quality and appearance was good but after 2 days of wearing the band it started to turn colors and the leather began to peel.
i want my money back, not worth it!
aluminum buckle broke on the first day
i had purchased the band a few months back i loved the color but i finally tried it yesterday and the top band is too big to fit on my watch.......
the connectors don't fit flush - there's a rather large gap between the watch and the connectors. shoddy craftsmanship. i wanted to like it, but had to return it.
missing metal buckle on one of the straps.
beautiful band, but broke me out in a rash 😕
feels and looks like plastic. very cheaply made.
my apple watch screen broke because of this strap. i fastened it and it fell right off! so upset!
after not even 30 use started to peel off.
the flimsy metal clasp broke about a week in and caused me to loose my watch.
i bought this as a gift in june. it broke literally a day after my return policy.
i would give this a lower rating if possible. the clip on the end of the band will not stay connected to the watch. i'm afraid to use it and risk having the watch fall off.
does not fit iwatch well. always a struggle to get on and off
this band is very small.  vendor must post what the length of this band is.  does not fit a larger wrist.
color fades on band very quickly..... do not buy for everyday use.
this band fell apart in less than a few months with minimal wears.
one of the bands does not fit in to the apple watch
just received my shipment today i opened go for box first.  really upsetting because in the center of the band were scratched, then went for the second item, looked over have two hole on the band, the silicone protector were force down pretty bad. over all errrr
very cheep material. wouldn’t recommend it.
attacked to much dirt , and isn’t to comfortable either!
poor quality as the fastening band fell off right way as i was trying to change the band. guess did not hold up even for 2 mins.
i purchased this item but i don’t know if it is good.
band is way to big comes to the front of wrist. makes it way to long. should have come smaller makes it look bulky.
this is not leather. other than that it's fine.
broke within two days and my watch screen broke
never again shop this items
not a fan. one of the holder straps broke the first week.
item is very cheap looking even for the price
wouldn’t slide into my apple watch
i received a empty package 😡
very bad quality
the band lost its colour in the first week and turned orange.
product broke easily :(  i had high hopes for it.
received the wrong color.
the band broke the first day
super cute but the clasp broke the first day that i wore it out. having my apple watch fall off and crash against a marble floor was terrifying, at least the watch remained in tact. beware.
very disappointed.
it was defective. very dissapointed.
worn the watch about a month and the color is wearing off
very uncomfortable
the strap keep coming off
this product broke once i tried to put it on. just received it two mins ago and it's broke.
disappointing watch band
i purchased this watch band and in less than 1 month it broke twice.  the clasp where the band connects to the watch fell apart.  the first time i found the piece that fell out of the clasp, and put it back together, the second time, after my watch band fell apart in a parking lot and fell on the concrete i returned this band - luckily there was no actual damage to the watch.  i realize these are after market watch bands and we are not paying apple prices but it should last more than 1 month.
looks like plastic in person
broke within the first week, unfixable
i purchased this band based on the reviews, sorry i did.  the band is poor quality and looks cheap.  i immediately removed it from my watch, definitely couldn't wear it outside my house.  hope my hubby can find the box in the trash, i'm returning.
watch out this band is too big its a male size not for a female i want to sent it back but it cost 5.99 to sent back dang! so sad...
cheap, fake leather
wife didn't like the fit and felt this was uncomfortable. unfortunately, we missed the return window after vacation.
it broke the first time i wore it :(
wore this band twice and it broke. very unfortunate that i cannot even return it.
the band became stuck in the watch and neither apple nor the manufacturer were able to provide any useful suggestions.  i had to take it to my watch repairman to get it removed. his analysis was that the band was not manufactured to specifications for the apple watch. the band is beautiful but now, sadly, unusable. beware!
band broke on first use. do not buy
horrible fit and finish. the band doesn't fit properly in my watch. the band itself doesn't lock into place in the watch and will just slide out. the leather doesn't look as it does in the ads picture. in person it looks like thick pleather not "100% genuine leather." i'm not going to be buying another band from these guys in the future. it was cheap for a reason. save your money and buy a nicer one if you're debating buying this specific band.
poor quality. having the stainless steel case and putting this band on made me feel like the guy putting stickers on a ferrari. it just looks flimsy and feels awful.
bought it twice and had to return it both times because of poor quality control.  the first time, one of the tiny screws that holds the watch mount loop in place was missing so it woudn't stay closed or be mounted on the watch. i returned it and tried again. the second one arrived intact but the watch mount on this one was machined just out of spec (too large) so it wouldn't slide into the watch channel without extreme force.
i really enjoy my band it was everything i expected and more the price was reasonable
this is crap. one side of this band got stuck in my watch. it just wasn't made properly. i had to use pliers to pull it out and broke the band in the process. you get what you pay for i suppose. buyer beware. this one isn't worth the money.
metal clasps broke within the month. like the color but quality was subpar.
after wearing this band off and on for about a month (i like to change my bands to match my outfit) the leather is worn and discolored.  it's not white anymore and in some places especially the inside wrist area, it's black see photo attached.  this was a complete waste of money, i can't even wearit anymore, it looks horrible.  i wish i could send it back but it's too late now.  unless you only want to wear the band once or twice do not purchase this product.  it is a complete waste of money.
do not buy!!!! broke the second i opened the box.
do not buy!!!! i was in simply walking and the band came off and completely smacked down and cracked! i will never buy this product again. the band breaks off and i always have to put it back it and it's a pain never ever buy this or this could happen to your watch!
faulty, cheap, material. the metal buckle fell off my band, so my watch fell of my wrist and shattered! the band is put together very poorly and uses cheap metals. if you care about the life of your apple watch, buy a band from another company
the strap broke within 4 hours and my watch dropped on the ground. i'm glad i have protection on my watch because it could have broken the watch. i'm also happy this happened at home because i don't think i would have heard it fall if i was out in a crowd. this is a band you do not want to buy. it would be easy to lose and/or break your watch. buyer beware .
loved this watch band for my apple watch.  perfect color.  but, it did not fit perfectly on one end and kept snagging everything.  it is not a perfect fit.  it might have just been mine.  but, then that end would not come out of the watch and took forever to separate.  scary!!!
arrived with a missing screw, so i requested a replacement. replacement arrived about a month later. i pieced the watch band together, only to have it fall apart after a few days of use.  luckily my watch wasn't damaged when it fell off my wrist but it easily could have been.
broke the second time i used this. very disappointing.
super disappointed with this cheap built material, due to the fact that the strap snapped on the first day i put it on!! as i was taking my shirt off it snapped and my watch fell face on the floor cracking the glass on my watch!!! now this cheap piece of crap is gonna cost me a lot of money to get my watch fix!! deffenetly don't recommend to buy this product!! note;( i never leave any bad reviews on anything but this is beyond disappointment)
the makers of this should pay for my watch. the belt totally came off causing my watch to fall on the floor and crack my screen. .
i was excited to get this as i wanted a nice leather band for my watch. the band wouldn't say on and pop off my wrist. luckily it fell on my couch and nothing happened to my watch.
terrible quality. looks great at first but then all of them started peeling in one month! i also didn't even use it every day. must of worn it for a total of 7 days, 2 of them have only been used for 3 days or so. missed the return window by one day as well. so disappointed especially since we bought 3.
looked great but after a month the "leather" started to wear away at the sides.  i had to purchase a different watch band and throw this one away.
the leather band broke in 2 weeks.
low quality. the “leather” flakes off very bad, which looked horrible on the pink band. it also rubbed on the buckle and changed to black. it cannot be cleaned. after two months of use i threw it away and bought a metal band from best buy. you get what you pay for.
i have only had this wristband approximately 1 week and the band is peeling. i wear my watch daily. if this band does not hold up to daily wear, it is not worth the money. i paid $11.99, normally $14.99.  i would have done better to buy a more expensive one at best buy that would last longer.
my husband wore this watch band once and a small part at the back of the band that connects to the watch fell out. how can i get the band changed when the time is past exchange. this is ridiculous.
unfortunately, one side of the band would not stay connected to my series 3 iwatch.  i don't have this issue with any of the many bands i have purchased for my iwatch.  however, i was impressed with the quality and look of the band.  it just would not stay attached so i returned it.
one of the bands does not lock!
got dirty fast and straps stink after a while
cheap
not sturdy, gave someone a high five and the bar that holds the band to the connector piece comes off. if i bump it, it comes off. would not recommend this product.
it’s a nice band, however it’s already starting to rip in the hole. don’t know if i’ll keep it. i’ve only had it on 5 days
too thick for the loops. swells up over time.
the leather is so cheap and very poor quality.
broken when i received. returned for my money back.
fell apart shortly after opening do not purchase, sent back for a refund.
didn't fit properly. one of the clasp bands didn't work.
the white rubs off to easily
positive: item arrived on time.
returned. "leather" looked cheap
it's way stiff and barely bends so you can actually put it around your wrist. and it rubs enough to where i have a red mark on my wrist. the color is pretty but that's about it.
too small
flimsy, does not feel very secure. worn once and have sat in my desk drawer since.
this band is good for 32mm screen case, not for 42mm apple watch. after installation, a big gap between screen case and hooker is seen.
ordered white leather and received gray.
terrible band - looks great at first - had it for just about 2 months now - already falling apart. have to buy another already, but won't be this band again
the leather changed colors after only a couple days of wearing it.
band is cheap looking
not genuine leather.  the color wears off quickly.  like all pleather bands, feels like there is no ventilation - very warm on the skin.
too big>
leather is stiff, color is not as shown on the screen (definitely not pink, more of a terrible orange beige color)
looks cheap. not real leather.
band to stiff ..
cheap leather.
this is not leather and very low quality. don’t bother with this item
this is the second one i’ve purchased. this one fell apart after 2 days of use.
the band fell apart the 2nd time l wore it!
terrible. came in the package broken. didn't even get the chance to put it on my watch. i want my money back.
it broke after wearing it once.
wrong size shipped. mislabeled packaging. great color though. disappointed it didn't work out.
very cheap feeling.
complete crap, one piece doesn't even click in snug on my watch. it just constantly slides back and forth. feels cheap
the color is actually more of a light brown/orange, not brown
had to replace within a month due to "leather" peeling. the white looks dirty and old.
cheap!!
horrible product!! it broke within a week of wearing it.
band was too large and didn't fit right. it was also very difficult to slide in and out of the apple watch. i would purchase a different product.
i don’t like this watch band got it for my 42mm watch it’s very loose the leather is cheap . not even worth wearing! packaging was fine came with a watch tool which isn’t necessary for an apple watch . very unhappy . it creased 2 hours into me wearing it
fell apart after one day. luckily i was sitting down when it came off so my watch only fell a foot or two otherwise many $500 watch would have shattered. i was able to find the screw and pieced it back together but at this point i am not going to trust this junk with my watch. i guess i should have spend more than $20 on a band for such an extensive watch so i feel like i should have known better but i guess you get what you pay for. returning.
the band looks awesome once it's on your watch. after about a week, the metal pin started sliding out of the connection to the watch. my watch ended up hitting the concrete and scratching just from brushing against leg.
didn't lock in properly. returned for credit & reordered.
the band is thicker and more masculine than it looks in the pictures. just didn't have a very dainty look for my small (women's) wrist. but the color and quality seemed good
the band was exactly what i wanted; too bad it gave me a really bad rash on my hand. no matter how much i washed my wrist, there are still tiny red, itchy bumps all over.
wtf i was sent a phone case not an apple watch band ??
very cheap looking
i was completely disappointed with this watch band. as soon as i opened the box i noticed it looked extremely plastic-y. i wasn't expecting premium leather at this price but i would've liked for it to at least some what resemble leather. it is very stiff and cheap feeling against the skin. also, if you have a big wrists like me, just skip this altogether. it was just barely able to fasten it closed on the last hole.
received an open box product. also crack at the end
this band has a watch band pin on it.  the pin came out twice and i lost my watch  because of it.  i later found my watch.  the price is not worth losing​ a $600 watch.
not nearly as good of quality as expected. comes made out of a very flimsy leather like material and does not feel very secure on the watch. can pull the clasps out vertically instead of sliding them, and they are meant and designed to slide.
very thin and cheap looking, mine ripped on the side after trying to put it on my apple watch. very disappointed
i purchased a couple of these for a gift and the leather is a great quality but the buckle left a horrible rash and they must be returned.
when i first got this band it was fine and looked great, and i was starting to doubt any of the bad reviews on it, but going into my 3rd week of wearing it everyday, it completely broke for no good reason. it seemed to just have fallen apart as i was wearing it one day.. really disappointed.. waste of money.
once i received it it worked perfectly but after i removed it and put it back one of the bands would not lock on my watch!!! i was only able to use it once after that the band did not work, do not recommend spending your money on these😑
horrible. the metal fastener bent first time i used it. not sure what the material is. very cheap.  will return.
poor quality. paint rubbed off immediately and the layers separated.
did not like the overall stiffness of the band and the buckle leaves marks on the band that make it look old and ugly!!
definitely not happy with the quality of this band. the attachments (to the watch) seem very cheap and dont seem to me that they fit all that well, even click together constantly. plus, even though i purchased this band via amazon prime, i have to drop off at a facility or take to khols if i chose to return, all reducing the refund of the band. super disappointed with this purchase. totally not worth it to me!
wore it 3x and the clasp broke off. almost lost my watch in the process. pos
cheesy quality, thin, pinched my wrist hair, guaranteed to give you a wax job without the wax. why? the distance between the metal loops are more sparse than the apple bands and other knock offs. the finish is also lower quality than some knock off milanese loops as well.
please read the 1 star reviews!  the metal piece attaching band to watch will break! wore 3 times and on third time (doing some activity, dancing at a wedding) my watch fell off and almost hit the floor, but alas i caught it before this happened. yes band looks great and the leather is fabulous,but a huge design flaw at the location where you need some strength.
poor quality and construction. used once and put away.
i loved the material it was made of when i first received the item, but within 3 days of me wearing it, the latch broke and the screw fell off. the screw went missing and my apple watch could've fallen and broke. i wasn't surprised that it broke because of the price i got it for, but breaking within 3 days is appalling. save your money, even if it's a cheaper amount. it's not even worth waiting for shipping and putting it on your apple watch.......3 days. ugh.
after 2 month band broke today :(
the glue that holds the magnetic closure failed in a little over a month of light use. amazon was kind enough to let me return, though i was a few days past the normal return window.
i've had this for a month and a half, wore it all day everyday — and i loved it! until a couple days ago, when the thin piece of leather that wraps around the metal part just broke. thankfully, i caught my watch before it fell onto the tile floor. now it's totally useless... i'd appreciate some help.
the leather band is nice looking and very functional.  the small metal piece that connects the leather and the slider that connects to the watch broke on two of these bands, (i ordered a 2nd on the off chance that it was a defect); both after only a few weeks of wear.  avoid!
cheap. broke within one week of use. not worth the money.
the band did not have a snug fit and also broke off at the hinges after a few days of use.
the one piece of the band that does not have the band on it slides in the watch and goes in from either side and slides right out the other. does not lock in place! looks good but can’t use it!
the screw got loose very quick. had this for about two weeks, and it could have really damaged my watch. trying to reach seller, but can't.
it’s doesn’t lock to my watch
cheap. the black finish wears off. the magnet isn’t strong enough and wears out fast. don’t waste your money on this item!
terrible, the screws came lose and the watch fell from my wrist inside of an airplane, just by luck, i looked down and saw my watch.
i wore this for only 2 days and it is already breaking
pulled my arm hair and was uncomfortable
junk! broke while attaching to watch. not worth my time to even send it back.
this watch band has sharp edges which ruined several shirts by pulling on the fabric.  i do not recommend it. it should get zero stars
the color is fading already! bad quality
it’s cool but the band ruins easily 😩
