211320083,jsam,5,"Excelente!","This is my favorite cut, the 511 I recommend it, they fit so good and tight but not too much"
119452847,JackBruno,5,"Perfect fit","These were purchased for myself about a month ago and the fit is great, very comfortable without being to tight. The classic jean fit and look, seldom do you get exactly what your looking for, but this was certainly it."
119445214,Akash,5,"Very Satisfied","Perfect fit and very comfortable. it's well almost in every style."
119428154,Caucus,5,"Size Runs Big","Taking the advice of another review I went from my size 34 x 30 to 33 x 30.. This was a much better fit.  Next pair I purchase will be 33 x 32.  It appears I need more length with a smaller size.  Levi does not have 33 x 31 so I will go with the 33 x 32"
119326215,tmg1,5,"Finally jeans that are short enough!!","My son is short and heavy, so he doesn't fit in youth sizes but men's sizes (30 if we are lucky and often 32) are WAY too long.  These pants with slim fit are just a tiny bit too long and he doesn't need to roll them 3-6 inches.  I've ordered 2 pairs already and will be ordering more once it starts getting cooler!"
119311033,RobluvsLevis,5,"So comfortable","Levi's stretch are great for bigger guys like me love comfort."
119012814,....,4,"Great fitting jeans, but....","Very hard to find a 29” length Jean in a retail store. Found it on The Levi site. The only issue I have is that it’s not a 29” length. Its a 30. Still love the jeans but wish I didn’t have have them shortened"

118339501,Phil63,3,"Size issue","These jeans are VERY tight and stretchy and the legs a bit short. In my case I'm 6" and weight 158, and have always used 32W-32L and the legs are a bit short and the waist a bit loose. Anyways, the quality looks good."

207498873,Bargainlover,5,"Did not prefer the Rinsed Playa wash","Liked the cut and fit of the 511 slim fit pant. Also liked the color of the Rinsed Playa wash. What I did not care for was the two different colors of thread used in the stitching. At first I thought it was a factory defect, using yellow and orange thread. When I went to the store to swap the jeans for another pair, it was discovered that is how the jeans are supposed to be. Returned them for a different wash color."
207493557,Rocky,5,"Good Quality","Like these new colors which are made for Macy's.  Also love Macy's star reward feature."

113149461,MarcusKilgannon,5,"Great fit, style and so far durability.","Have owned these jeans for about a year now and they look identical to when I originally bought them. They've held up great with continuous wear and are comfortable and fit great. Bought a few different style 511s from the success I had with these and I have had the same quality with all them. Highly recommend the 511 line. #win501"

Dear Sir / Ma’am 
Greetings 
Very nice product....trendsetter!!!
It was really fits for my needs and a kind of pants you can wear for any occasions!"
205787267,Shubho,5,"Apt fit for business casual!","Right size and fit; 
The good thing about the '511 Slim Fit' is that it is not too tight (aka drain pipe fit) or too loose (like the straight / classic).
Apt dressing for business casuals."
205749270,Alphadogi,5,"Only Levis","This style is my son's favorite, he loves the tight fit along with the stretch."
205454181,shopper,3,"College kid","My son loves these jeans but they only lasted 5 months.  Levis do not last like they used to"
111692246,CrashDaddy,4,"Great Fit","I love the style and fit of 511 Levi's. My only complain t is that the colors are in correct in the images. I ordered what looked like Tan Brown and what arrived is easily Olive Green. Not a Levi's problem, more of a Kohl's problem."
205260042,Sissy,5,"Excellent Jeans!!","I bought these for my grandson and he loves them!! Highly recommend!!"
204214391,Macysshopper,5,"Great!","Very comfortable and the color and styling look great. Bought same style in 2 colors"
204199709,TrueNaturelover,2,"Favorable aspects and unfavorable","The quality of the fabric is good. Fit is very large in the waist; I downsized two inches. The fit in the legs is nicely tailored, not in the least baggy. The color selection is terrific. But a glaring problem is the oddly short rise. It's downright uncomfortable. There's the distinct, awkward feeling that the pants are about to constantly slip down because the rise is so short. I have never encountered anything like it - and I know it is not a defect because I tried a second pair. I regard it as a major design flaw.  I just cannot imagine how a man can be comfortable with this design.  A teenage girl, maybe.  If not for the peculiar rise, these jeans would be perfect. Regrettably, they're returned."
204183569,RAYF,5,"GREAT FEEL!","These jeans stretch so I purchased the size 33"W which also fit better in the seat and gave me a more tailored look. They are slim, but not tight giving up the comfortable feel."
204178919,Zach,5,"Great look and feel!","I always have to wear all black for work. Always go back to Levi because they last, have a great look and I always dress up going out. So when I’m not working I can always dress them up! Duel purpose! Affordable. Breathable. All around always a great buy! Love them!"
204110762,PracticalShopper,5,"Great Jeans!","I love these jeans on my husband. The fit is great and the material is quality."
203952463,danny,5,"Right fit","Son loves jeans perfect fit for them they like this style"
203795713,None,5,"Great fit","Best fitting jeans for my super skinny son, I just wish the material was a bit thicker."
203755521,DeAndre,4,"Good jeans","Good quality jeans. Fit well. Tight in the beginning but loosens up. I would recommend them."
203754744,colo5,5,"best purchase","nice jeans I will recommend it. Good price. nice customer service.
Thanks."
203384429,Susie,5,"Finally A Pair That Fit","After buying a dozen of pair of jeans for my college son I finally found a pair that fit and he likes. Since he has been a nightmare to shop with or for since the day he was born so when he said he wanted clothes for Christmas I begin to panic. 
He is the type that has to move in all different directions to make sure the jeans will fit and be will be comfortable in all situations. (I pity his wife someday). They also have to be just roomy enough in the thigh then taper down.  The cuff has be to narrow but not too narrow. Plus they have to be a modern and attractive look.
So if these by chance you are buying for or are a person who needs a great quality jean that fits this description then this is the jean for you."

I'm not physically fit or skinny like any of the models shown in the pics. I'm average build and they fit perfect. The stretch denim offers plenty of comfort making them feel very roomy for a slim fit jean while still offering a clean modern fit.
